According to analysts at multichain wallet BitKeep, the BRC-20 token standard is a novel form of fungible token that “employs Ordinals and Inscriptions to create and manage token contracts, token minting, and token transfers, which are stored on the Bitcoin base chain."" Ordinals is a numbering system that assigns a unique number to each satoshi, or 0.00000001 Bitcoin

, enabling its tracking and transfer. Meanwhile, the “inscription” process adds a layer of data to each satoshi, allowing users to create unique digital assets on the Bitcoin blockchain.

The BRC-20 token standard was developed by Twitter user Domo on March 8. Currently, there are over 14,000 BRC-20 tokens deployed on Bitcoin compared to an estimated 400 million tokens on Ethereum. Despite its traction, BitKeep researchers wrote, “BRC-20’s creator has openly stated that the standard is worthless and that users should not waste money mass minting this fun experiment.""

On May 8, BitKeep announced that it would soon support the ordinals protocol and BRC-20 protocol on its mobile and plugin-extension platforms. A new Bitcoin NFT section will also be included in the BitKeep NFT marketplace, allowing for the display, minting, transfer and trading of BTC NFTs based on the ordinal protocol. Developers wrote:

“BitKeep will continue to monitor new protocols, such as BRC-21, and provide more diverse support and services based on market trends and user demands.""

Despite being enthusiastic about its outlook, Trust Wallet does not support Bitcoin ordinals. Meanwhile, MetaMask added a new feature allowing users to store ordinals in February. Cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider Ledger also supports the ordinals protocol.

Cryptocurrency adoption continues to grow, especially more as of late, as the recent banking crisis has highlighted the challenges of the traditional financial system. Despite all the doom and gloom that came in the first quarter from the Fed’s inflation-fighting rate hike campaign, banking turmoil and growing concerns that the economy is headed for a recession, Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 has risen significantly, up to 80% year to date. Many traders seem to believe that the dollar will gradually lose some of its preferred reserve currency status, with crypto being one of the beneficiaries.

Newcomers may join the crypto market for various activities, such as staking, yield farming, play-to-earn gaming and more, but trading still plays a central role.

Despite the fact that digital assets are a relatively new asset class for private investors to trade and invest in, the crypto market is very similar to traditional trading in some key aspects.

Those who have previously traded other instruments, especially forex pairs, can easily transfer their skills and experience to crypto trading while taking into account the unique characteristics of this market.

In particular, because both markets are highly technical, liquid and volatile, strategies used to day trade forex can frequently be applied to crypto.

There are several aspects of forex trading that can be similarly applied to crypto trading:

Technical analysis — analyzing historical price data to identify patterns and trends is an important skill that can be used in crypto trading. Forex traders read charts and use this information to understand market trends. From candlestick charts to technical analysis indicators such as moving averages, Bollinger Bands, the relative strength index (RSI) and a stochastic oscillator, this experience is easily transferable to crypto trading. The price action of cryptocurrencies fluctuates according to the same supply-and-demand principles as forex pairs, although digital assets are often more volatile.
Risk management — forex traders are well-versed in risk management strategies, which are especially relevant to cryptocurrency trading. The crypto market is volatile and unpredictable, requiring traders to effectively manage their risk in order to avoid significant losses. Forex traders are familiar with concepts such as stop-loss orders and position-sizing, which can be applied to crypto trading to minimize risk.
Continuous markets — forex traders are often attracted to the OTC forex markets because they offer a wider range of trading times than many listed markets, and the continuous active trading hours can make it easier to get into and out of positions. While forex is attractive because it trades 24 hours a day excluding weekends, crypto trades nonstop, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Navigating trading platforms — forex traders are acquainted with navigating various platforms and using different trading tools. This experience can be useful in cryptocurrency trading, where traders have to switch between different exchanges, trading platforms and tools. Those with prior experience in traditional trading would have familiar experience while exploring crypto trading tools, including the interface, charts and indicators.

Previous trading experience helps crypto traders

Crypto traders can indeed learn a lot from traditional trading. A survey commissioned by regulated forex broker OANDA in November last year found that 64% of American crypto traders believe that previous trading experience in other assets gives them an advantage when trading crypto. When asked about specific assets, 37% of respondents said they had previously traded forex, and 42% later revealed that they had used traditional trading methods, including in-app or trading platform charts and technical analysis to help them navigate the crypto market.

Interestingly, 47% of respondents with previous forex trading experience said that they used the day trading approach to crypto trading, 42% implemented positional trading strategies, while 40% relied on their experience with event trading, a strategy that seeks to take advantages of price fluctuations that may occur before or after a market-moving event.

In general, the higher the volatility of an asset, the greater the potential for higher returns or higher losses over a short period of time.

Digital assets tend to have even higher volatility than traditional fiat currencies, which makes the application of day-trading and scalping strategies developed in forex trading useful for crypto traders, especially considering that the crypto market is available 24/7.

Jessica Beckstead, managing director of North America and United States CEO of OANDA, commented:

“Digital assets can help traders diversify from traditional financial assets such as fiat currencies or equities. Unlike fiat money, most cryptocurrencies don’t see their value diluted by inflation, but they remain highly speculative and unpredictable. There’s no doubt that crypto can be volatile, but for some traders, this volatility provides a thrill — it can mean significant gains, but also higher risks. Given this volatility, traders may want to consider using features such as stop losses to protect their profits and manage their risk.”

Crypto trading has particularities

While crypto trading has similarities to trading traditional assets, digital assets are in a league of their own. Many distinctive aspects set crypto assets apart, such as higher volatility, regulatory vagueness, a wide variety of new tokens and token types, and more sophisticated concepts related to decentralized finance and smart contracts. Nevertheless, the experience of trading traditional assets always comes in handy.

The OANDA survey mentioned above also showed that the main barrier to crypto trading is a lack of knowledge, with 57% of respondents sharing that they don’t feel confident in their knowledge. Other reasons for reluctance to trade crypto were “lack of historical data to make projections” (21%) and “lack of tools to plan trades and spot opportunities” (10%).

Most of these barriers are mitigated for those with some experience trading traditional assets, as they can borrow powerful tools from forex trading platforms like OANDA.

Finally, crypto adoption is supported by a boom in financial literacy observed across all cohorts over the past two decades.

The promise of DeFi: Underdelivered or an ongoing journey?

Despite the challenges DeFi faces, the promise of a financial system free of central authority remains tantalizing.

It’s 2023, and decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a major trend in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, with the emergence of protocols and the promise of building a financial system “free” from the control of central authorities. However, despite its potential benefits, DeFi has faced its fair share of criticism for its lack of true decentralization.

Undermining the fundamental principles of decentralization, many DeFi protocols are still subject to centralized control and oversight by a select few. “DeFi is not decentralized at all,” said Samson Mow, former chief strategy officer at Blockstream, in a discussion with Cointelegraph about how DeFi projects are governed by entities that can change the protocols at will.

The decentralization illusion

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are touted as the future of decentralized corporate governance, functioning without a centralized hierarchy. However, DAOs have failed to achieve their intended level of decentralization. A study by Chainalysis revealed that less than 1% of all holders have 90% of the voting power, indicating a significant concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a select few. This finding highlights a critical problem, as DAOs were created to address the issue of centralized power.

Source: Chainalysis

This was exemplified in July 2022, when popular DeFi lending protocol MakerDAO was scrutinized for its centralized decision-making process. A new proposal was put forth to the MakerDAO community for the implemention of a new governance structure that would centralize power in the hands of a smaller group of stakeholders, including the project’s largest investor, Andreessen Horowitz.

However, there was significant pushback from the community on the grounds that it would undermine the decentralized and democratic nature of the project. This controversy also highlighted the ongoing debate in the DeFi space about the balance between decentralization and efficiency, and the challenges of maintaining a truly decentralized system.

Emerging promise

While there is concern as to the state of decentralization, there is also promise slowly emerging in the DeFi space.

A good example is Canto, a relatively new and fast-growing layer-1 blockchain solution in the Cosmos 

ATOM

$10.45

 ecosystem. The project has recently made waves in the market with its goal to truly deliver on the promise of decentralized finance by providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications.

Canto is still in its early stages and faces significant competition from established DeFi protocols such as Aave or Yearn.Finance 

YFI

$7,278

. However, Canto’s unique architecture and focus on true decentralization have caught the attention of many in the cryptocurrency community. The project has been successfully launched without a token presale, official foundation, vesting rounds or venture capital funding. Moreover, Canto’s goal is to build a “free public infrastructure,” which means that its decentralized exchange (DEX) cannot issue its own tokens in the ecosystem, unlike Uniswap 

UNI

$4.96

 and SushiSwap 

SUSHI

$0.89

.

Due to the project’s promise to build an accessible, transparent and fully decentralized ecosystem, many crypto and financial platforms such as XGo are listing Canto’s very own native token, CANTO.

Strong foundations and community confidence matters

Of course, projects can have strong missions, but the crux of a protocol lies in its foundation and the confidence the community has in it. For example, in 2020, Uniswap, the highly reputable Ethereum-based DEX with a strong mission to promote financial freedom and inclusivity, faced heavy scrutiny when its first governance vote on the platform failed despite receiving 98% support from voters.

This failure raised questions about the strength of Uniswap’s foundation and governance structure. Despite having a strong mission, a failed governance vote highlights the importance of a solid foundation and governance structure to ensure the success and sustainability of a project.

Emerging projects like Canto once again boast an impressive lineup of developers and have the confidence of the DeFi community to back its talent. According to the pseudonymous “Spector,” lead developer at Alto, a free public NFT marketplace on Canto, it would be “interesting to try a feeless marketplace that is monetized via Canto’s CSR (contract-secured revenue) while respecting the royalties set by the creators.”

Spector also praised Canto’s core contributor Zak Cole, with whom he has worked, touting Canto as an “ideal sandbox for new ideas, with the expertise of Zak and other core contributors driving innovation in the blockchain space.”

DeFi needs to reorient itself

As DeFi continues to gain popularity, the debate around true decentralization will remain ongoing. However, as projects begin to pivot focus toward creating a truly decentralized platform that is accessible and transparent, the promise of DeFi is getting closer.

This shift toward decentralization will help create a more equitable and decentralized financial system, paving the way for a future where DeFi is a viable alternative to traditional finance. As the DeFi space gains recognition and traction, it will be interesting to see where the ideal sandbox will — or rather can — go.

According to a May 8 post by Miller Thomson, the law firm representing users of the defunct cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, interim distribution of funds tied to bankruptcy proceedings will be scheduled “in the coming weeks.""

Bankruptcy trustee Ernst & Young announced the interim distribution in consultation with estate inspectors. In the near future, the trustee will post a Notice to Affected Users regarding details about the manner and procedure of the distribution. According to Miller Thomson, a small number of affected users are expected to receive a Notice of Disallowance of Claim, which means that the creditor’s claim has been revised or disallowed in the bankruptcy process. 

“If you received a Notice of Disallowance, you have the right to appeal the decision,"" Miller Thomson explained, adding: 

“The first step is to review the reasons for the revision or disallowance and gather any necessary evidence to support their claim. In this case, the Trustee is most likely to have issued a Notice of Disallowance if there was a discrepancy in your proof of claim.""

QuadrigaCX, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in Canada, became insolvent in February 2019, shortly after its co-founder, Gerald Cotten, died in India, taking the private keys to QuadrigaCX’s offline storage systems to his grave. According to the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC), QuadrigaCX owes its affected clients an estimated $160 million. In addition to losing access to cold storage, the OSC alleges that Cotten realized $86 million in crypto trading losses on the QuadrigaCX platform, which was then covered with users’ funds. 

Since then, bankruptcy trustee Ernst & Young has recovered $34.3 million worth of assets. “We did not identify any other assets beyond those identified by Ernst & Young,"" wrote the OSC.

According to the announcement on May 9, the Canton Network will be a privacy-enabled interoperable blockchain network aimed at those working with institutional assets. It will allow the synchronization of financial markets that were “previously siloed.”

The network will begin testing its capabilities in July, which include extensive privacy controls and the ability to achieve the scale and performance needed by major financial institutions. Participants in the network currently include BNP Paribas, Cboe Global Markets, Digital Asset, Paxos, Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, Deloitte and others.

Cathy Clay, executive vice president of Cboe Global Markets — one of the partners in the project — said that, when leveraged, blockchain technology can potentially “unlock” new opportunities in the market.

“The tokenization of real-world assets may offer an unprecedented opportunity to create new market infrastructure and drive efficiency in the trading of products across the globe.”

Canton is built on Daml, the smart contract language of Digital Asset, which creates an interoperable system where “assets, data, and cash” can synchronize across linked applications.

ANALYSIS
Join us on social networks

As the burgeoning blockchain technology paradigm has continued to evolve, a whole host of unique asset classes have started to make their way into the mainstream. Private equity tokens are one such offering, serving as digital representations of ownership in private equity investments powered by a decentralized ledger. 

These tokens enable fractional ownership, improved liquidity and simplified management of private equity assets. They are created through a process called tokenization, which involves converting real-world assets into digital tokens that can be bought, sold or traded on various platforms.

Recent research indicates that private equity and hedge fund assets are the most likely to see tokenization in the near future. The study surveyed fund managers in France, Spain, Germany, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, collectively responsible for around $546.5 billion in assets under management, and found that 73% of the participants identified private equity assets as the most likely first to see significant tokenization.

Moreover, the World Economic Forum has estimated that up to 10% of global GDP could be stored and transacted via distributed ledger technology by 2027, with crypto-asset custodian Finoa reporting that tokenized markets may be worth as much as $24 trillion by the same year.

As a result, most fund managers (93%) overwhelmingly believe that alternative asset classes — such as private equity — are highly likely to be targeted for tokenization due to their inherent lack of liquidity, transparency and accessibility compared with traditional asset classes.

The financial proposition of private equity tokens

One of the most enticing aspects of private equity tokens is the potential for enhanced liquidity.

Traditionally, private equity investments have been plagued by long lock-up periods and limited exit opportunities, making them unappealing for some investors. However, by tokenizing these assets and enabling them to trade on secondary markets, private equity tokens can offer a much more liquid alternative.

This new level of liquidity not only allows investors to enter and exit positions more easily but also helps unlock the value of illiquid assets, making them more attractive to a broader range of investors.

In addition to improved liquidity, private equity tokens also offer increased transparency in an industry that has historically been opaque. The use of blockchain technology, which underpins these tokens, allows for the public tracking of ownership and transactions, providing investors with a real-time, transparent view of the underlying assets. This level of transparency can help build trust and confidence in the private equity space and reduce the risks associated with fraud and mismanagement.

Furthermore, these tokens democratize access to the private equity market, breaking down barriers to entry for retail investors. By allowing investors to purchase fractional ownership in private companies or funds, they create opportunities for smaller investments, thus enabling a wider range of individuals to participate in the growth of private companies. This democratization of access not only diversifies investment portfolios but also fosters innovation and economic growth as more capital is funneled into the private sector.

Speaking to Cointelegraph, Nikolay Denisenko, co-founder of Swiss neo-digital bank Brighty and former lead backend engineer for Revolut, noted the aforementioned benefits of tokenization for private equity. However, he said that “there are factors that could potentially limit the growth and adoption of private equity tokens. One key factor is the regulatory environment, which is still evolving in many jurisdictions. Ensuring compliance with securities laws and Anti-Money Laundering regulations can be a challenge.”

Recent developments surrounding the space

While venture capitalists have eagerly financed blockchain technology to revolutionize the banking sector, they have been more hesitant to adopt it for their own operations. However, recent initiatives to tokenize private funds seem to signal a significant shift in this mindset.

For example, Pierre Mauriès — who previously served as the private equity technology practice director at PwC and a mergers and acquisitions strategy executive for The Carlyle Group — recently founded Nemesis Technologies. The company is tokenizing a $500 million fund that will become available on Securitize, a digital security issuance and compliance platform. The process will transform the fund stakes into digital tokens, allowing investors in the United States and Japan to trade them on Securitize’s brokerage platform, Securitize Markets.

In a recent interview, Mauriès emphasized the importance of tokenization for the future of alternative investments, highlighting several benefits for limited partnerships. For instance, Nemesis fund investors can trade tokens after four years, offering earlier liquidity than traditional models. Additionally, the digital nature of the tokens simplifies fractionalization and sale to other investors compared with the conventional secondary market.

Other prominent firms like KKR, Apollo, Hamilton Lane, Backed and Partners Group are also spearheading jumping into the private equity tokenization movement. Backed, in particular, recently introduced its ERC-1400 security standard-based private equity token, BACD. 

The firm claims that the token’s features include faster settlement speeds, automated compliance through smart contracts, 24/7 trading and better transparency. BACD tokens represent private equity ownership and function as utility tokens for exchange and payments.

Lastly, private equity’s early adoption of tokenization seems primarily driven by the desire to expand investor bases, as tokens provide retail investors with easier access to private equity. By offering digital tokens, PE firms can potentially engage with 13.6 million accredited investors managing $75 trillion in the United States alone, according to Securitize CEO Carlos Domingo.

Potential drawbacks

As the legal and regulatory frameworks surrounding tokenized assets continue to evolve, looming uncertainty can make it difficult for private equity firms and investors to navigate the tokenization process and adhere to local and international regulations.

Furthermore, the market for trading tokenized private equity assets is still relatively nascent, which can result in limited trading volumes and reduced liquidity for these tokens when compared with more established, liquid asset classes.

Technological security, such as the stability of the underlying blockchain technology, is crucial for successfully implementing tokenized private equity. Blockchain networks can be vulnerable to hacks, system failures or other technical risks, which could compromise the integrity and value of the tokenized assets.

Moreover, widespread market adoption is necessary for tokenized private equity to reach its full potential, but this requires significant buy-in from private equity firms, investors and other stakeholders, which may be challenging due to traditional industry practices and resistance to change.

Tokenized private equity assets may also face skepticism from potential investors who associate blockchain technology and tokenization with the volatility and unpredictability of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

. Overcoming this reputation risk may require extensive education and marketing efforts.

Tokenizing private equity can also introduce extra complexity, particularly for investors unfamiliar with digital assets, blockchain technology or the process of trading and managing tokenized assets.

Lastly, while blockchain technology can offer enhanced security, storing and managing digital assets requires stringent security measures to protect against hacking, phishing and other cyber threats, which can introduce new risks and challenges for private equity firms and investors.

In the view of Brighty’s Denisenko, these tokens can majorly impact liquidity and market volatility. While increased liquidity may benefit some investors, it could also lead to higher volatility in the market.

This may affect both retail and institutional investors, who may not be prepared for sudden price fluctuations. To mitigate this risk, it is essential to establish robust secondary markets with appropriate risk management mechanisms and to educate investors about the potential risks and rewards associated with private equity tokens.

“The problem is that having an uncontrolled secondary market is not the best-case scenario for the company because it makes it hard to reduce volatility. Hence, total decentralisation is not a workable option, only through oracles and the DAO’s approval,” Denisenko concluded.

Recent: AI’s black box problem: Challenges and solutions for a transparent future

Despite these drawbacks, the potential benefits of tokenizing private equity are significant. As the technology and regulatory landscape continue to evolve, these challenges may be mitigated or addressed entirely.

Looking ahead

While the core concept pervading tokenization may not necessarily provide investors with a significantly expanded pool of potential market participants, the primary attraction surrounding tokenized private equity lies in the simplified experience it offers smaller investors with limited means.

Moreover, as tokenization gains traction in the private equity domain, more established financial entities will likely adopt this innovative approach. With the support of industry leaders such as KKR, Apollo, Hamilton Lane and Partners Group, the tokenization movement is well-positioned to reshape how private equity investments are managed and traded. Thus, it will be interesting to see how this relatively nascent market niche continues to mature moving forward.

The proportion of investments in cryptocurrencies among investors interested in digital finance has risen significantly since 2021, from 16% to 26%. However, the interest in potential investments in crypto has crashed this year, with just 12% of investors indicating it, down from 45% in 2021. As highlighted in the report:

“Opinions on cryptocurrencies seem to have crystallized: a greater proportion of family offices are now invested in cryptocurrencies, but the proportion that are not invested and not interested in investing in the future has grown more.”

The report is based on a survey conducted between January and February 2023 via questionnaires distributed to home offices by email. Overall, 166 home offices participated, 95 of which are based in the Americas, 34 in Europe and the Middle East, and 37 in the Asia Pacific.

Goldman Sachs appeared among the top winners during the recent banking crisis, with many investors deciding to rotate their portfolio investments. Goldman Sachs’ money funds have received $52 billion — a 13% growth — in the biggest monthly volume of inflows since the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Coinbase’s legal chief has requested the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) make several revisions to its proposed regulation on the responsibilities of registered investment advisers (RIAs) for storing client assets with qualified custodians.

Although the SEC acknowledges Coinbase Custody Trust Company as a “qualified custodian,“ Coinbase contends that the updated RIA custody rule unfairly targets crypto and makes improper assumptions about custodial practices based on securities. According to a May 8 letter from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the proposed SEC rulemaking fails to safeguard other asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company is recognized as a qualified custodian for RIA clients. This custodian is responsible for protecting client assets from potential threats such as bankruptcy and cyberattacks.

This letter advocates for expanding the custody obligations proposal to ensure that it remains adaptable to future investments and protects them appropriately.

An RIA is a company that advises clients on investments in securities and may handle their investment portfolios. These firms are registered with the SEC or state securities administrators, depending on the value of the assets under management.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

To send and receive payments on the Lightning Network, users must first set up a Lightning wallet and fund it with Bitcoin. From there, they can create payment channels and start transacting. This article will guide users through the process, from setting up their Lightning wallet to making their first Lightning payment.

What is the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network (LN for short, or simply “Lightning”) is a decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that prevents users from delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties. It is a layer-2 protocol — a computer network built on top of the Bitcoin base layer (layer 1), the actual blockchain. The Lightning Network uses the Bitcoin base layer’s high protection standards to secure the network.

Bitcoin is a payment system designed to be slow, and its transactions are finalized in as long as one hour; this is because Bitcoin assembles transactions into blocks spaced on average 10 minutes apart, and payments are considered secure after confirmation of six blocks, which is about one hour. This is not ideal for micropayments and smaller transfers that are typically inefficient due to high base-layer fees.

Imagine people waiting one hour to pay for a coffee or a train ticket when they scan their phone through the station gate. The high fees add up to make the whole payment process clunky, inefficient and too costly for everyday Bitcoin network transactions.

The Lightning Network solves these problems as one of the first implementations of a multi-party smart contract using Bitcoin’s built-in scripting. On the Lightning Network, payments are instant, atomic and are not recorded on the blockchain; therefore, they don't require block confirmations to finalize. Lightning can be used by retailers for their point-of-sale terminals, by individuals for device-to-device transactions such as remittance payments, or whenever instant payments are needed without the validation of third parties.

The Lightning Network allows users to quickly send and receive Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 with virtually no or minimal fees while achieving a throughput (message delivery rate) of approximately 1 million transactions per second (TPS). Compared to Solana, with 65,000 TPS, or even Visa, which has the infrastructure to process around 24,000 TPS, the Lightning Network is by far the fastest payment method available.

To meet the increasing demand for Bitcoin payments and micropayments, the network will need to support a much higher volume of transactions, which would be impossible to scale on the layer-1 chain. This is why the Lightning Network is considered by many the solution to scale Bitcoin in a way that doesn’t affect its decentralization and without delegation of trust and ownership.

How to pay on the Lightning Network

Users need to get a Lightning Network-enabled Bitcoin wallet — where funds are placed into a two-party, multisignature “channel” Bitcoin address — to make Bitcoin Lightning Network payments. Understandably, the person or the business to be paid will also have a Bitcoin wallet with access to Lightning.

Most wallets are mobile due to a phone’s ease and frequency of performing instant payments. Examples of Bitcoin Lightning wallet apps include Muun, Wallet of Satoshi, Phoenix and Cash App, and they can be downloaded on both iOS and Android devices. Muun facilitates submarine swaps, a fast trade between on-chain and off-chain digital assets.

Submarine swap is a type of off-chain cryptocurrency transaction that allows for the exchange of one cryptocurrency for another. It uses the Lightning Network to facilitate fast and low-cost transactions. Phoenix (a non-custodial wallet) and Wallet of Satoshi provide nearly instantaneous safe payments with minimal fees.

Most wallets are non-custodial, meaning that the Bitcoin funds are under the custody of the owners only, and they have a multi-signature feature as an extra layer of protection for the private key.

By depositing BTC into a Lightning wallet, users open a channel, and that is their entry into the network. Even if it’s impossible to see, every time a user pays a new person or a new business with the Lightning Network, the user opens a channel with that counterparty.

This channel can be direct and created on purpose between two parties to transact easily. Alternatively, it can be a routing payment over Lightning, allowing Lightning transactions between two unconnected parties to use a series of pre-existing channels.

Once users establish a channel, they will access the entire network’s public channels, all stitched together and ready to route payments, with lightning nodes searching for the best route to perform the transaction. This is why when users pay a new retailer, they can do it instantly just by scanning the QR code, without having to open a direct channel.

Payments occur through a channel instantly, with near-zero fees, without going through Bitcoin’s base layer all the time.

Making a payment through the Lightning Network is as simple as any other digital payment method and can be done by following these steps:

Open the payer’s wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Send.”
Scan the merchant’s or an individual’s QR code button or enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

Similarly, to receive Bitcoin with Lightning, the following steps may help:

Open your wallet on the Lightning page.
Click on “Receive.”
Scan your QR code button on the payer’s device or have the person enter the address manually.
Confirm everything is correct and proceed with the checkout.

The Lightning Network wallets may be suitable for keeping a small amount of Bitcoin for everyday expenses. However, it is important to note that manually entering a payment address on the Lightning Network can be error-prone and time-consuming. In contrast, scanning a QR code provides a more accurate and faster way of entering the payment address and, therefore, completing the transaction.

How to fund your Lightning Network wallet with BTC

In order to open a channel or process a payment, a user will need some BTC funds in the wallet. To upload Bitcoin to a wallet, here are the usual steps to follow:

You should set up your wallet to use the Bitcoin base chain (Bitcoin wallet) or the Lightning Network (Lightning wallet). Select the wallet network you want to use.
Go to “Receive” and click on it.
Check the transaction details are correct.
Scan the QR code or copy and paste the receiving address onto the wallet you’re getting your funds from.
You have the option to add an invoice for the payment. Click on the “Invoice” button to proceed.

Once you’ve received BTC and opened a channel, you can send and receive Bitcoin with no time or amount limits. The Lightning Network is still considered experimental and must be refined, and it is therefore recommended not to store a significant amount of BTC in a Lightning wallet.

Who runs the Lightning Network

The Lightning Network is an open-source project that was ideated by research scientists Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja in 2015. Starting as a way to address the significant increase in Bitcoin’s transaction fees, the project developed a new payment system built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. In January 2016, the duo published the white paper, and the project started gaining more traction among developers and investors.

The same year, Lightning Labs — the company developing and maintaining the Lightning Network — was co-founded by Elizabeth Stark. The organization released a beta version of the ecosystem for developers to test, highlighting the value that layer-2 solutions can bring to the greater ecosystem.

With increasing amounts of funding and interest around the Lightning Network, such an ecosystem is gaining growing traction among Bitcoin enthusiasts, especially in light of the Lightning Network smart contract set up, which may open opportunities in decentralized finance and other applications.

How to receive Bitcoin on the Cash App

To deposit Bitcoin into Cash App, Bitcoin withdrawals and deposits must be enabled within the app by taking the following steps:

Click on the “Money” tab on your Cash App home screen.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Deposit Bitcoin” to get started.
Copy your Bitcoin wallet address onto the sender’s relevant box.

A wallet’s unique address can be used to receive Bitcoin from a third party to your account and will change after each successful deposit to ensure more privacy. Users can deposit up to $10,000 worth of Bitcoin in any seven-day period. As transferring Bitcoin occurs in the base-layer chain, it may take hours for transfers to be confirmed.

How to use the Cash App Lightning Network

In October 2022, Cash App added the Lightning Network to the Bitcoin wallet to enable Bitcoin’s faster transactions with little to no fees. Here’s how to send BTC using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Click on the payments “$” tab on Cash App to view the home screen.
Select the QR scanner on the top left corner of the screen.
Hold your camera over the Lightning invoice QR code to scan it.
Follow the instructions to confirm and pay the request.

Similarly, the following steps illustrate how to receive Bitcoin using the Cash App Lightning Network:

Open Cash App and click on the Money tab.
Select “Bitcoin.”
Click on “Receive” Bitcoin.
Share the QR code or link with the sender and scan.

To receive Bitcoin with the Lightning Network, the sender doesn’t need a Cash App account to pay a user’s request, but the sender will need a Lightning-enabled Bitcoin wallet.

Moving funds with Lightning addresses (LNURLs)

The Lightning Network is gradually being adopted across the crypto community and service providers, including exchanges. Kraken was one of the first to implement Lightning in March 2022. Moreover, in April 2023, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong announced a Coinbase-Lightning Network partnership, meaning one of the most popular exchanges in the world will be adopting Bitcoin’s instant payment network soon.

In December 2022, Lightning addresses were added to the Lightning Network. A Lightning address is like an email address but for Bitcoin, a straightforward way for anyone to send Bitcoin instantly on the Lightning Network, ushering in a new standard for how value moves around the world.

LNURLs gained a lot of traction recently when Armstrong apparently failed to recognize the Lightning address of Cointelegraph journalist Joe Hall, missing a payment due to the writer and stirring some debate on Twitter. Lightning addresses are a crucial addition to Lightning payment services, even though they will take time to be fully adopted.

It’s 2023, and decentralized finance (DeFi) has emerged as a major trend in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space, with the emergence of protocols and the promise of building a financial system “free” from the control of central authorities. However, despite its potential benefits, DeFi has faced its fair share of criticism for its lack of true decentralization.

Undermining the fundamental principles of decentralization, many DeFi protocols are still subject to centralized control and oversight by a select few. “DeFi is not decentralized at all,” said Samson Mow, former chief strategy officer at Blockstream, in a discussion with Cointelegraph about how DeFi projects are governed by entities that can change the protocols at will.

The decentralization illusion

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are touted as the future of decentralized corporate governance, functioning without a centralized hierarchy. However, DAOs have failed to achieve their intended level of decentralization. A study by Chainalysis revealed that less than 1% of all holders have 90% of the voting power, indicating a significant concentration of decision-making power in the hands of a select few. This finding highlights a critical problem, as DAOs were created to address the issue of centralized power.

Source: Chainalysis

This was exemplified in July 2022, when popular DeFi lending protocol MakerDAO was scrutinized for its centralized decision-making process. A new proposal was put forth to the MakerDAO community for the implemention of a new governance structure that would centralize power in the hands of a smaller group of stakeholders, including the project’s largest investor, Andreessen Horowitz.

However, there was significant pushback from the community on the grounds that it would undermine the decentralized and democratic nature of the project. This controversy also highlighted the ongoing debate in the DeFi space about the balance between decentralization and efficiency, and the challenges of maintaining a truly decentralized system.

Emerging promise

While there is concern as to the state of decentralization, there is also promise slowly emerging in the DeFi space.

A good example is Canto, a relatively new and fast-growing layer-1 blockchain solution in the Cosmos 

ATOM

$10.45

 ecosystem. The project has recently made waves in the market with its goal to truly deliver on the promise of decentralized finance by providing a secure and scalable infrastructure for building decentralized applications.

Canto is still in its early stages and faces significant competition from established DeFi protocols such as Aave or Yearn.Finance 

YFI

$7,278

. However, Canto’s unique architecture and focus on true decentralization have caught the attention of many in the cryptocurrency community. The project has been successfully launched without a token presale, official foundation, vesting rounds or venture capital funding. Moreover, Canto’s goal is to build a “free public infrastructure,” which means that its decentralized exchange (DEX) cannot issue its own tokens in the ecosystem, unlike Uniswap 

UNI

$4.96

 and SushiSwap 

SUSHI

$0.89

.

Due to the project’s promise to build an accessible, transparent and fully decentralized ecosystem, many crypto and financial platforms such as XGo are listing Canto’s very own native token, CANTO.

Strong foundations and community confidence matters

Of course, projects can have strong missions, but the crux of a protocol lies in its foundation and the confidence the community has in it. For example, in 2020, Uniswap, the highly reputable Ethereum-based DEX with a strong mission to promote financial freedom and inclusivity, faced heavy scrutiny when its first governance vote on the platform failed despite receiving 98% support from voters.

This failure raised questions about the strength of Uniswap’s foundation and governance structure. Despite having a strong mission, a failed governance vote highlights the importance of a solid foundation and governance structure to ensure the success and sustainability of a project.

Emerging projects like Canto once again boast an impressive lineup of developers and have the confidence of the DeFi community to back its talent. According to the pseudonymous “Spector,” lead developer at Alto, a free public NFT marketplace on Canto, it would be “interesting to try a feeless marketplace that is monetized via Canto’s CSR (contract-secured revenue) while respecting the royalties set by the creators.”

Spector also praised Canto’s core contributor Zak Cole, with whom he has worked, touting Canto as an “ideal sandbox for new ideas, with the expertise of Zak and other core contributors driving innovation in the blockchain space.”

DeFi needs to reorient itself

As DeFi continues to gain popularity, the debate around true decentralization will remain ongoing. However, as projects begin to pivot focus toward creating a truly decentralized platform that is accessible and transparent, the promise of DeFi is getting closer.

This shift toward decentralization will help create a more equitable and decentralized financial system, paving the way for a future where DeFi is a viable alternative to traditional finance. As the DeFi space gains recognition and traction, it will be interesting to see where the ideal sandbox will — or rather can — go.

The rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) spearheaded a new era of digital ownership and investment. With a record number of new NFT collections launched in 2022, the NFT market capped $50 billion in sales volume for the first time. As a fast-growing market operating entirely in the digital world, however, it didn’t take long for the NFT industry to become a haven for fraudsters.

A recent report unveiled that in 2022, more than half of the NFT activity on the Ethereum blockchain, the most popular network for NFT trades, was fraudulent. From wash trading to copycat collections, the NFT market entered 2023 with a set of critical issues that could only be solved by advanced market intelligence and analytics. Assessing a fair price for an NFT is already tricky, as tremendous gaps between the floor price and the price ceiling are not uncommon for collections. On top of that, malicious market activity only adds more confusion to users’ NFT investment or trade decisions.

While NFTs from popular collections such as the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) hold immense value in the market, it’s relatively easy to copy the visual appearance of apes depicted in the collection as image files and then create fake NFTs based on copycat material. The $1.53 billion sales volume of the BAYC collection in 2022 presents a lucrative market for fake NFTs as well.

The impact of counterfeit NFTs

Fake NFTs created by copying the image of original art can be difficult to detect in the digital environment, resulting in significant financial losses for buyers. The impact of fake tokens in the NFT market includes economic, legal and reputational consequences. Investors who lose confidence in the ecosystem due to fake NFTs are less likely to return to the market. Without significant demand, the prices of NFTs are bound to drop.

Without proper tools, NFT collectors can quickly get confused trying to find an authentic NFT on the marketplace and trace its history. Luckily, recent tech developments in artificial intelligence (AI) now allow for the prevention of NFT buyers from investing in fake content. NFT analytics provider bitsCrunch recently launched an AI-powered tool that checks major blockchains and marketplaces for potential copycat or forged NFTs.

Fake NFTs caught by AI

By analyzing over 800,000 assets on the top NFT marketplace OpenSea against the top-40 NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain, bitsCrunch found out that 144 copycat NFTs are exact visual matches to the BAYC collection. Moreover, 231 NFTs were flagged as near-exact matches, while “extremely similar” copies are as high as 814.

Over 140 fake NFTs are indistinguishable from the original BAYC collection. Source: bitsCrunch

The fake NFT issue is hardly exclusive to BAYC. Other trending collections, including Azuki, Otherdeed and CloneX, have tens of exact copies detected by AI-powered analytics. bitsCrunch detects forged material across blockchain networks and flags newly-minted and existing counterfeit NFTs by analyzing real-time data.

AI-powered price estimation for NFTs

Confusion across the NFT market also arises when users want to put a fair price tag on an NFT they aim to sell, as floor price — the lowest-priced item listed for a specific collection — rarely gives a reliable perspective.

Many factors, including trading volume and history, last traded price and the profile of previous buyers, come into account when deciding the final price of a digital collectible. However, AI can now aid buyers and sellers in the form of the NFT Price Estimation tool by bitsCrunch. Aiming to accurately determine the true value of NFTs, the Price Estimation tool uses analyzed historical info and metadata for an NFT combined with the social media hype around the collection to provide more accurate price estimates.

The AI-driven machine learning tool has studied over 30 million NFTs from more than 2,200 collections to apply advanced data and analytics, benefiting the user when making buying or selling decisions.

The full potential of the NFT space can only be unlocked via tools that fight against issues like wash trading and forgery plaguing the market for the last couple of years. Users need AI-powered advanced analytics and intelligence presented on easy-to-understand screens to benefit from market data.

bitsCrunch offers accurate NFT analytics and forensics with UnleashNFTs to supply users with reliable insights into the market. The platform provides in-depth analysis, research and statistics about the NFT ecosystem, helping buyers and sellers to make better decisions with each NFT trade.

Additionally, as part of its commitment to bring more awareness and data transparency to the NFT ecosystem, bitsCrunch has launched its startup program. Companies working with NFTs can join this initiative to get quick access to bitsCrunch tools for analyzing and managing risk via API. Equipped with AI-powered analytics, NFT creators, traders and businesses can detect and avoid malicious activities while making transactions, thus expanding the NFT ecosystem in a healthier direction.

Although the SEC acknowledges Coinbase Custody Trust Company as a “qualified custodian,“ Coinbase contends that the updated RIA custody rule unfairly targets crypto and makes improper assumptions about custodial practices based on securities. According to a May 8 letter from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the proposed SEC rulemaking fails to safeguard other asset classes, such as cryptocurrencies.

Coinbase Custody Trust Company is recognized as a qualified custodian for RIA clients. This custodian is responsible for protecting client assets from potential threats such as bankruptcy and cyberattacks.

This letter advocates for expanding the custody obligations proposal to ensure that it remains adaptable to future investments and protects them appropriately.

An RIA is a company that advises clients on investments in securities and may handle their investment portfolios. These firms are registered with the SEC or state securities administrators, depending on the value of the assets under management.

In the letter addressed to the SEC, Grewal criticized the proposed rulemaking titled “Safeguarding Advisory Client Assets, Proposed Rule 223-1” as misguided. Grewal called for a revision to the proposal and staff guidance, highlighting the need to safeguard all asset classes, including crypto assets, which haven’t been classified as securities until now.

Grewal suggests several revisions to the rule to protect investors, including defining state trust companies and other state-regulated financial institutions as qualified custodians, a longstanding congressional and SEC policy. He also proposes allowing limited exposure to non-qualified custodians and removing the ban on RIA client trades on crypto exchanges, which are not qualified custodians.

The SEC is expected to comply with the court order and respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus this week. Coinbase filed a lawsuit in April 2022, requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets.

While the Ordinals protocol was initially used to mint images as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users began to realize that they could use text-based inscriptions to create fungible tokens in a similar way to those minted via the ERC-20 token standard on the Ethereum (ETH) network.

These text-based inscriptions, now popularized as the BRC-20 token standard, have been the main cause of the massive uptick in Ordinals inscriptions on the Bitcoin blockchain.

As highlighted by Glassnode co-founder and chief technology officer Rafael Schultze-Kraft on Twitter, text-based inscriptions are now the most popular form of Ordinals inscription, with more than 2.8 million text-based inscriptions as of May 5.

More recent data from popular blockchain data hub Dune Analytics shows that since April 25, the overwhelming majority (99%) of all new Ordinals inscriptions have been text-based.

According to brc-20.io, a new tool that allows users to track BRC-20 tokens, there are currently a total of 14,200 new tokens hosted on the Bitcoin blockchain. Counted among the most popular Bitcoin-based tokens are “ordi”, “nals” and even a Bitcoin-based version of the now-notorious memecoin Pepe (PEPE) being listed at number 3 by total market cap.

While the total market cap of BRC-20 tokens currently hover around the $700 million mark, digital asset investment firm Galaxy Digital asserts that the market for “Bitcoin NFTs” may reach $4.5 billion by 2025.

The rise of Ordinals over the last few months has continued to spark debate around whether Ordinals are ultimately a positive for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Some Bitcoin proponents, such as Dan Held, claim that Ordinals offers a wider spread of financial use cases for Bitcoin, while more hardline Bitcoiners argue that Ordinals stray from the original vision of Satoshi Nakamoto, who intended for Bitcoin to be used as an electronic, peer-to-peer cash system.

Meanwhile, miners have enjoyed an enormous influx of revenue due to the transaction fees related to the burst of new activity on the network.

$27,770

 mining firm Core Scientific has objected to paying a $4.7 million administrative claim put forward by crypto lender Celsius Network, leading to a battle between the firms over contractual obligations.

According to the objection filed in Texas bankruptcy court on May 5, Core Scientific has asked that Celsius Network’s $4.7 million administrative claims be rejected as the firm cannot prove it is entitled to one.

“Celsius’ request for allowance and immediate payment of the Celsius alleged admin claim ignores that Core has substantial claims against Celsius, which Core believes exceed the Celsius alleged admin claim,” wrote the objection.

For context, Core first signed a contract with Celsius in 2020 to host its cryptocurrency holdings in Core’s data centers. However, due to an increase in the price of power, Core passed these additional costs on to Celsius, an allowance that was reportedly stipulated in the original contract.

Despite Celsius initially paying these costs, the crypto lender ceased payments after it filed bankruptcy, Core Scientific claimed in the objection.

“If anyone has been unjustly enriched here, it is Celsius,” Core Scientific wrote in the objection. According to the now-defunct Bitcoin miner, Celsius has been “sitting on almost $8 million of money it owes to Core” due to a “blatant post-petition violation” of the agreed-upon dispute resolution mechanism.

Celsius now owes Core Scientific a total of approximately $11 million, a sum that accrues an additional $28,000 in fees and interest with each passing day, the Bitcoin mining firm’s lawyers argued.

The conflict between the two firms has been raging since Oct. 19, when Core Scientific first accused Celsius of failing to pay its power bills, citing the non-payments as a significant factor in the liquidity issues that led to the embattled Bitcoin miner filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 21.

“The millions of dollars Celsius shortchanged Core after Celsius’s bankruptcy filing plus the millions of dollars in litigation…significantly contributed to Core’s liquidity drain and eventual chapter 11 filing.”

On Dec. 28, Core Scientific filed a motion seeking approval to reject Celsius’ contracts, claiming the firm’s failure to pay its power bills constituted a material breach of contract. On Jan. 3, Celsius agreed to let Core Scientific shut down more than 37,000 Bitcoin mining rigs that the miner was hosting for the crypto lender.

A single trader just spent a staggering 64 Ether — equivalent to $118,000 — in gas fees purchasing $155,000 worth of a memecoin called Four (FOUR).

According to an update from the popular blockchain tracking service Whale Alert, the lone trader paid an astonishing $119,157 in Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 to complete a Uniswap trade that swapped 84 Wrapped Ether (WETH) for 13.8 billion FOUR tokens.

It appears as though the trader voluntarily increased their gas fee to speed up the transaction time to purchase the memecoin. According to pseudonymous Twitter user FlurETH, the trader in question is sitting on 133 ETH ($245,667) in unrealized profit on their investment in the memecoin.

Gas fees on the Ethereum network have become the subject of debate amongst the crypto community, with a number of prominent Etheruem advocates praising the heightened activity for its revenue generating effects and long-term deflationary pressure on the supply of Ether.

Others have leveled criticism at the fees, claiming that unless the network becomes more “affordable” mass adoption will never be achieved.

As reported by Cointelegraph, one of the main drivers behind the increase in Ethereum gas fees comes from the recent memecoin mania, driven in large part by the frenzied buying of a new memecoin called Pepe (PEPE). At the time of publication, the average Ethereum transaction fee is sitting at $22.98, the highest level recorded since May 12, 2022, when the average fee reached a peak of $31.11.

Another major reason behind the drastic uptick in gas fees comes from the maximal extractable value trading bot that is front-running memecoin trades en masse. The notorious MEV bot and “sandwich” attacker, known only by the pseudonym jaredfromsubway.eth, has been profiting significantly from the heightened network use.

A sandwich attack occurs when an attacker “sandwiches” a victim’s transaction between their own two transactions in order to manipulate the price and profit from the user.

On April 18, Jared cleared a whopping $950,000 in profits from the sandwich attacks. Jared has also been one of the largest gas spenders on the Ethereum network. On April 20, Jared used 7% of the total gas on the network and spent 455 ETH in transaction fees.

According to the Twitter announcement, the first version of the Spark Protocol will act as a “lending marketplace,” providing users with supply and borrowing features for cryptocurrencies such as Ether 

ETH

$1,854

, staked Ether (stETH), DAI 

DAI

$1.00

, and staked DAI (sDAI). The platform is specifically designed for DAI and aims to provide users with access to competitive interest rates.

The Spark Protocol is also linked to Maker’s D3M (Direct Deposit Dai Module), a system that enables interaction between the Maker ecosystem and third-party lending pools. The link between Spark Protocol and Maker’s D3M seeks to enable users to borrow DAI at more competitive rates, with an initial annual rate of just 1.11%. 

Regarding the connection between Spark Protocol and Maker’s D3M, the announcement noted: “This direct wholesale credit line in DAI injects and automatically balances fresh DAI liquidity into Spark Lend and enables its users to access the best rates in the market.” 

Ultimately, the Spark Protocol lending solution promises to enhance MakerDAO’s DAI lending capabilities, increase liquidity, offer users improved rates, offer a yield-bearing version of DAI and provide more liquidity options.

MakerDAO recently proposed a new “constitution” designed to establish and formalize its governance processes, as well as safeguard against potential threats from malicious actors who may attempt to take over the protocol. 

To ensure the security and stability of the Maker Protocol and protect user funds from potential failures or losses due to human and institutional decisions, MakerDAO’s new constitution utilizes “alignment engineering” to solidify the core commitments of the Maker community.

After a turbulent month for the crypto industry in March, Bitcoin’s 

BTC

$27,770

 price went sideways in April despite some volatility. The meteoric rise of memecoins, such as PEPE, made headlines, and First Republic, another mid-sized United States bank, went under. However, on the basis of current market sentiment is a standoff between markets and policymakers: While the U.S. Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell publicly states that interest rates are unlikely to come down this year, the markets for risk-on assets like crypto have firmly priced in a pivot in the coming months.

In times like these, it is wise to drill deeper into the fundamentals that will shape future market movements. With an uncertain macro environment and a looming regulatory crackdown in the U.S., there are other notable developments that are easily drowned out by these dominant news items.

The report is available for free on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.

For those keen to gain a deeper understanding of the crypto space’s various sectors, Cointelegraph Research publishes a monthly Investors Insights Report that dives into venture capital, derivatives, decentralized finance (DeFi), regulation and much more. Compiled by leading experts on these various topics, the monthly reports are an invaluable tool to quickly get a sense of the current state of the blockchain industry.

NFT hype fades as memecoins take over

Nonfungible token (NFT) collectibles are one of the few sectors that took a major hit this month. Memecoins, such as PEPE, may be partially responsible for this, as they absorbed the attention, printing eye-watering gains. BRC-20 tokens, a new abstraction created on the Bitcoin Ordinals protocol, may also compete for cash inflow from traditional NFT collectibles traders. Sellers have started to persistently outnumber buyers on NFT marketplaces recently, and this trend is likely to continue.

There are concerns about the NFT market going into free fall, as all important metrics, such as volume and active wallets, have been on a steep decline. NonFungible reported only 49,200 active wallets and a sales volume of $80,500 this month. The NFT marketplace wars, combined with diminishing excitement around NFTs, are other driving factors behind this long-term development.

Despite the overall NFT market slump, a niche NFT sector that is picking up steam is the NFT lending market. Since the start of 2022, this sector has witnessed double-digit growth every month, and this continued in April with a 16.13% increase in new users.

Mining stocks outperform BTC

Every Cointelegraph Research Monthly Trends Report includes coverage of mining economics and crypto stocks. For investors interested in increasing their exposure to BTC, mining stocks have historically been a popular option. While idiosyncratic factors have negatively impacted individual stocks this month, the sector as a whole seems to have exited from the 2022 bear market.

The highest returns were again recorded by TeraWulf, which continued its rally with another 85% rise in evaluation. CleanSpark, IrisEnergy and BitDigital were other strong gainers. Notably, the stocks in April outperformed BTC on aggregate after lagging behind in the previous month. Where Bitcoin only posted a 2.8% close, the largest crypto stocks, dominated by mining, recorded 12.9%

Of course, increased evaluations in the mining industry are highly sensitive to BTC’s price action. For those with confidence in improving macroeconomic conditions for risk-on assets, these stocks may offer good entries as they were previously battered by the bear market. The stocks section of the monthly report tracks the fundamentals of major companies in the industry and thus amends our regular analysis of Bitcoin mining economics.

Just hours after the initial decentralized exchange offering (IDO) for Cetus began on May 8, its hard cap target of 800,000 Sui (SUI) tokens has already been surpassed, with over 6 million SUI committed worth approximately $6.85 million at the time of publication. Developers claimed that the IDO reached its initial goal in less than 30 seconds after the sale went live.

Cetus is a DEX and liquidity protocol built on Sui and Aptos. The IDO, which is scheduled to take place from May 8 to 10, is still ongoing despite the initial target being reached. During the IDO, 20 million Cetus tokens (CETUS) are up for grabs out of a total supply of 1 billion CETUS. Users can commit SUI in exchange for CETUS at an exchange rate of 1 SUI to 25 CETUS. The rules and token metrics of the public sale, along with the price of SUI, would place the Cetus DEX at an initial valuation of $45.8 million. 

The IDO has a hard cap of 800,000 SUI. According to developers, when the total commitment surpasses this amount, “Each purchaser’s final purchase amount accepted by the Seller will be a portion of their committed amount, calculated proportional to all the respective committed amounts from all purchasers in the IDO.”

Although IDOs can surpass their initial goals due to popularity, others can also reach this outcome simply by the way their public sale is designed, i.e. ""surpassed"" on purpose. Like their initial coin offerings counterparts, investments in IDOs are considered to be high risk and can be subjected to rug pulls, scams, or lack of traction thereafter. 

A layer-1 blockchain created by former Meta executives, the Sui mainnet officially launched on May 3, along with listings of its Sui token. The SUI public sale took place weeks prior, with an offering price of 0.1 Tether 

USDT

$1.00

 per SUI.

Immediately after the listing, the price of SUI opened at $4.50 apiece with a fully diluted market capitalization of $45 billion before plunging 75% to trade at $1.14 at the time of publication. Before the listing, Binance introduced Sui LaunchPools, where users could stake either BNB 

BNB

$313

 or TrueUSD (TUSD) for a limited supply of SUI rewards. The LaunchPools reached nearly $4 billion in total value locked in just two days.

Join us on social networks

The risk/reward ratio or risk/return ratio is a commonly used metric in trading that compares the potential profit of a trade with the potential loss. That said, it’s the reward traders stand to make for the risk they take. 

For example, an investment with a risk/reward ratio of 1:3 would mean that for every dollar the investor spends, they gain three dollars if the trading goes in their favor. The risk/reward ratio is decisive to cryptocurrency trading, whether for daily trades or crypto investment for the long run, known as “hodling.”

To gain a better understanding, let's consider it in the context of crypto trading.

How to calculate the risk/reward ratio

Assuming that the prevailing price of Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 is $2,000, a crypto trader might decide to enter a long position (buy) with the following parameters:

Entry price: $2,000

The price at which they purchase ETH.

Stop-loss: $1,800

Should the price of ETH go down, which is not in the trader’s favor, the stop-loss point is where they would sell the ETH acquired (for a loss) and avoid further losses. In other words, they’re risking $200 per ETH bought at $2000.

Take profit: $3,000

If the price of ETH goes up, the take profit price is the point they would sell the ETH, which, in this case, would be for a profit of $1000, a reward of $1000 per ETH.

Plenty of risk/reward ratio calculators are available online for cryptocurrency trading. Using the above example, here’s how to manually calculate the risk/reward ratio:

The initial risk is $200 per ETH (the distance between the entry price of $2,000 and the stop-loss price of $1,800).
The take-profit level offers a reward of $1,000 per ETH, which gives a risk-reward ratio of 1:5 ($200 risk divided by $1,000 reward).

Here is the formula for the risk/reward ratio:

What are the pros, cons, buts and howevers of the risk/reward ratio?

The risk/reward ratio helps traders evaluate a trade’s potential risks and rewards, and make decisions accordingly. It allows traders to manage risk effectively by setting stop-loss orders and take-profit levels, limiting potential losses while maximizing profits.

However, the risk/reward ratio is a measure for managing risk and does not guarantee success in trading because:

It is based on assumptions about an asset’s future price movement, which may not always hold.
It can be oversimplified and may not consider other important factors, such as market conditions, liquidity and transaction costs.

For example, if the market suddenly becomes highly volatile (high price fluctuations), a trader may need to keep adjusting stop-loss or take profit levels. And the crypto market is known to breed volatility.

After calculating the risk/reward ratio, the trader should evaluate whether it suits their trading strategy and risk tolerance. That said, one cannot rely solely on the risk/reward ratio for cryptocurrency trading. Traders should use it with other risk management strategies, trading plans and discipline to succeed.

How to optimize the risk/reward ratio?

What is considered a good risk/reward ratio? While 1:2 is regarded as a practical and optimal risk/reward ratio in crypto (as well as traditional trading), there are no fixed rules for its use, with the ratio depending on the traders’ expectations and strategy.

Arriving at the optimal risk/reward ratio requires balancing a trade’s potential risk and reward, which depends on risk tolerance and trading strategy. Several metrics can accompany the risk/reward ratio or enable traders to optimize it.

Here’s how to use the risk/reward ratio for crypto trading:

Position size

The position size is not necessarily a measure or metric; it’s the amount of capital (crypto asset capital) allocated to each trade. Determining the position size is a critical component of trading risk management strategy. It helps to control potential losses and profits of a trade.

The position size directly impacts the risk/reward ratio, i.e., a larger position size can increase a trade’s potential profit and the possible loss. Conversely, a smaller position size may limit the potential profit and loss.

Win rate

The win rate is the percentage of the total number of profitable trades to the total trades, measuring how often a trader’s trades are profitable. A high win rate means the trader consistently makes profitable trades and doesn’t need to rely as heavily on big winning trades. Accordingly, the trader can afford to use a lower and safer risk/reward ratio, which can still be profitable because the trader is winning more often.

On the other hand, a lower win rate means that the trader needs to rely more on big winning trades to make money and face the volatility risks associated with a more significant risk/reward ratio.

Maximum drawdown (MDD)

Maximum drawdown is an essential metric for traders to consider when assessing their trades’ risk/reward ratio. It is the biggest percentage drop a trader sees in their trading account from its highest value before the decline started. It measures the largest amount of money a trader lost in their account from its highest value before things started going downhill. So how does maximum drawdown influence the risk/reward ratio?

Suppose a trader has a risk/reward ratio of 1:2, meaning they risk $1 to potentially make a profit of $2. Furthermore, imagine the maximum drawdown of the trading strategy is 50%. In that case, the trader could potentially lose half of their trading account before the strategy turns around and becomes profitable again.

As such, even though the risk/reward ratio is favorable, the strategy’s overall risk may be too high. One way around this is to use a narrow stop-loss and avoid the potential loss of the maximum drawdown. However, this translates to a lesser risk/reward ratio.

It’s about finding the right balance between managing the maximum drawdown risk and maintaining a favorable risk/reward ratio.

Expectancy

Expectancy measures the likelihood of making a profit over the long term on a series of trades or investments. It measures the long-term profitability of a trading or investing strategy. Positive expectancy is more or less like the ultimate objective of all trading initiatives.

Akin to the win rate, the loss rate is the unprofitable percentage. The average win and loss sizes are the average profits and losses on a series of trades or investments.

The risk/reward ratio plays a critical role in determining expectancy. A high risk/reward ratio means that potential profits are more considerable than potential losses. This means that if a trader wins 33% of their trades with, say, a 1:2 risk-reward ratio, their average win is twice as large as the average loss, which, in turn, translates to higher expectancy. Conversely, for a low risk/reward ratio, traders would need more wins (win rate).

What factors should be considered while determining the risk/reward ratio in cryptocurrency trading?

Several factors often influence cryptocurrency trading and the risk traders will take to hit the desired profits. Here are a few:

Crypto market volatility

If there is one thing the cryptocurrency ecosystem is infamous for — apart from the hacks and rug pulls — it is how volatile its trading scene is. Set risk/reward ratio with careful consideration.

Liquidity

In simple words, liquidity refers to reserves, tokens or token pools readily available for exchange. It translates to the ability to buy and sell assets quickly and easily. Low liquidity of a crypto asset can increase the risk of trading and make it more challenging to realize profits.

Strength of underlying technology

What the trading token stands for, i.e., the problem it solves and the potential of its growth, greatly influences the risk of trading with it. The more reputed and established the token, the lower the risk of trading with it.

Regulatory landscape

The cryptocurrency world has a long way to go regarding the regulations jurisdictions create around it. And each new (or updated) law directly impacts trading sentiment.

Related: What is profit and loss (PnL) and how to calculate it

How important is the risk/reward ratio in cryptocurrency trading?

Just as a seesaw balances two opposing forces, the risk and reward of an investment opportunity must also be carefully balanced. The risk/reward ratio requires constant adjustments and vigilance to maintain balance and avoid the pitfalls of either extreme.

As detailed in this article, there are many ways to optimize it and several factors influencing it. While it is an important metric, it is not a holy grail solution that guarantees success in any crypto trading strategy. Understand and experiment with how it plays into the broader set of trading strategies and risk management.

When interviewing for Web3 jobs, it’s important to be prepared for a range of questions that may vary depending on the specific role and the company you are interviewing with. That said, there are some common interview questions that you can expect to encounter.

These questions typically cover your understanding of the Web3 ecosystem, your experience with blockchain technologies, your contributions to decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, your approach to problem-solving and collaboration, and your ability to address security and scalability challenges.

However, keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to Web3 job interviews, and the specific questions you encounter may vary depending on the job requirements and the interviewer’s priorities.

What is your understanding of the Web3 ecosystem, and how do you see it evolving in the coming years?

This is one of the most crucial questions you might be asked during a Web3 job interview because it tests your familiarity with the market and your perception of its possible future development. Candidates with in-depth knowledge of the Web3 ecosystem, including blockchain technologies, DApps and smart contracts, may be desired by the interviewer.

Although this might show your capacity to keep abreast of new trends and react to changes, they might also be interested in your views and ideas on how the industry is expected to change in the upcoming years.

To answer this question effectively, it’s important to demonstrate a deep understanding of the Web3 ecosystem, including current developments and potential future trends. Highlight any specific areas of expertise you have, such as a particular blockchain protocol or DApp platform.

Additionally, demonstrate your ability to think critically about the future of the industry by discussing emerging trends, such as the growth of decentralized finance (DeFi) or the integration of Web3 technologies into traditional industries.

The interviewer will be looking for a candidate who is knowledgeable, passionate and able to communicate their ideas clearly and concisely. Be sure to back up your statements with specific examples or evidence to showcase your understanding of the Web3 ecosystem and your ability to think critically about its future.

How have you contributed to the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts?

The interviewer may be interested in understanding your skills in programming languages, such as Solidity, which is used to write smart contracts for Ethereum-based DApps.

To answer this question, start by discussing your experience in building or contributing to DApps and smart contracts. Highlight any specific projects you have worked on, the programming languages you used and the contributions you made. Be sure to mention any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

Additionally, emphasize your understanding of how DApps work and how they differ from traditional web applications. Showcase your knowledge of decentralized systems, such as blockchain, and how they enable DApps to be secure, transparent and trustless.

Lastly, discuss your passion for working with decentralized technologies and your desire to contribute to their development. The interviewer will be looking for a candidate who can demonstrate a strong understanding of DApp and smart contract development and a passion for contributing to the growth of the decentralized ecosystem.

What is your experience with blockchain technologies, and how have you integrated them into your projects?

 This question evaluates one’s practical experience utilizing blockchain, including their ability to create or contribute to initiatives based on the technology, create smart contracts or use blockchain platforms to address real-world issues. It is crucial to show your experience with various blockchain technologies, programming languages and tools in order to respond to this question properly.

Describe your background working with blockchain briefly before highlighting some of your most important projects or accomplishments. Talk about any difficulties you encountered and how you overcame them, as this shows that you can solve problems. Showcase your teamwork skills when using blockchain and talk about any collaboration or planning you did with other developers, stakeholders or consumers.

Finally, focus on how you incorporated blockchain technologies to add practical value to your projects. This can involve utilizing blockchain for decentralization, security or transparency, as well as its distinctive properties to create cutting-edge platforms or applications. At the end of the day, the interviewer is seeking a candidate who can show that they have a solid grasp of blockchain technologies, real-world experience creating or contributing to blockchain-based projects, and a vision for how blockchain may be utilized to address challenges in the real world.

How did you tackle the security and scalability challenges of Web3, and what actions did you take to reduce them?

The interviewer may be looking for examples of how you have implemented measures to improve security and scalability, such as using smart contracts, sharding or other scaling solutions. Start your response to this question by describing the specific security and scalability difficulties you have encountered and the measures you have taken to address them. You might describe how you employed a specific scaling solution to improve the performance of a DApp or how you created a security protocol to secure a blockchain-based application.

Emphasize any standards or best practices you have used to guarantee the security and scalability of your Web3 projects. This can involve executing frequent security audits, adhering to industry-standard security practices or stress-testing your projects to ensure scalability.

Can you share examples of successful Web3 projects you have worked on and how you collaborated with your team to solve problems during those projects?

This question is meant to gauge how well you approach problem-solving, team collaboration, and your experience working on successful Web3 projects. Provide examples of Web3 projects you have worked on and describe your position in each one to begin answering this question. Mention the difficulties you encountered while working on the projects and your approach to tackling problems, along with any tactical or strategic choices you made. Be sure to highlight how you and your team collaborated to overcome those obstacles and produce good results.

Talk about any particular techniques or tools you employed to promote teamwork and communication. Software for project management, recurring check-ins or daily stand-up meetings are a few examples. Share any lessons you learned from past projects and how you used them in later initiatives.

Finally, be sure to express your love for Web3 technologies and your willingness to keep working on fruitful initiatives in this area. A candidate with a proven history of teamwork, problem-solving and producing positive results will stand out in the interview.

Worldcoin, a project to identify humans and distinguish them from artificial intelligence, has launched a gas-free crypto wallet for verified humans, according to a May 8 announcement.

The new wallet, called “World App,” works on Android and iOS operating systems. It currently runs on the Polygon 

MATIC

$0.8803

 network, allowing users to hold and transfer United States Dollar Coin 

USDC

$1.00

, Dai (DAI), Ether 

ETH

$1,854

, Worldcoin (WLD) and Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC).

World App uses the project’s “World ID” system to discriminate between humans and bots. Users who want to take advantage of gas-free transfers must first register for a World ID by supplying a phone number or iris scan. Developers say the project doesn’t store users’ data. Instead, it generates a zero-knowledge proof to verify the user is human, but without revealing the data used to generate the proof.

Even users who don’t have a World ID can still use the app, but they can’t take advantage of the feeless transactions. The announcement said the app relies on account abstraction to allow for third-party gas payment.

The project has partnered with regulated crypto exchanges, including Moonpay and Ramp, to offer onboarding and offboarding within the wallet. Once coins are held in the wallet, they can be swapped through built-in Uniswap integration. Users can also connect their phone numbers to the app to send and receive crypto through phone contacts.

In a conversation with Cointelegraph, Worldcoin Core team member Tiago Sada stated that the wallet was created to offer a simple option for inexperienced crypto users.

“When we first started, we actually just went out with normal wallets, the wallets a power user like me would use day-to-day, and it turns out those were too overwhelming for normal people. There were too many options, too many things to do, [it was] not super clear,"" he said. ""We’re launching [World App] as a product so that there is this alternative wallet that is focused just on simplicity.”

Worldcoin was co-founded by Sam Altman, who also co-founded ChatGPT developer OpenAI.

The Australian blockchain company Everledger has reportedly entered insolvency proceedings after failing to raise new funding from an undisclosed investor.

Everledger, which uses blockchain to track the provenance of diamonds and other goods, failed to make its latest funding round happen, the AFR reported on May 8.

Subsequently, Everledger was quietly placed into voluntary administration as the firm could not pay its debts. All Everledger employees were given layoff notices on March 31, with Vincents Chartered Accountants being appointed as administrators on April 24. The first meeting of creditors was scheduled for May 8.

According to Everledger founder Leanne Kemp, the company’s management was forced to take this decision to protect the interests of shareholders.

“The second tranche of funding due to Everledger did not materialize, and subsequently, we understand that there are external reasons and pressures on this investor, which has meant Everledger was placed in a difficult and unexpected position,” Kemp said.

One of the critically important decisions was an immediate redundancy of employees and to hold the firm in control of administrators while its affairs were finalized, the founder added.

Kemp went on to say that Everledger planned its latest investment around the last external funding round required before profitability. “I would not suggest Everledger was a ‘cash burning’ startup,” she stated, adding:

“Certainly, our use of capital and operational footprint was in total alignment with the board’s direction under a controlled growth plan. This is not a company that scaled too fast or took on venture capital and burnt it in 18 months.”

Everledger did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment.

The company’s insolvency proceedings come despite Everledger being backed by major investors, including the Australian government and the Chinese internet giant Tencent.

In 2019, Tencent led Everledger’s Series A round with a $20 million investment. According to the AFR, Everledger also secured $3.5 million from the United Kingdom Government’s Future Fund in 2021. Over the past eight years, Everledger has reportedly raised $51.7 million in external investment.

Founded in 2015, Everledger is one of the world’s major companies pioneering blockchain-based platforms for tracking supply chains. Some companies, including the Danish logistics firm Maersk and the United States technology company IBM, have terminated their blockchain supply chain tracking products, citing a lack of “global industry collaboration.”

Despite major industry closures, the concept of blockchain-based supply chain platforms is still thriving in some parts of the world. Hong Kong-based Global Shipping Business Network continues building blockchain-based supply chain products and is bullish on blockchain as a crucial logistics tool in the long term.

The approval of the National Blockchain Policy for Nigeria has left the nation’s crypto community over the moon as it signals room for more development in the nation’s crypto industry. Some local experts have expressed their opinions about the implications of this new policy and the blockchain ecosystem in Nigeria.

The government of Nigeria approved a National Blockchain Policy during a meeting on May 3, 2023. A policy draft stated that blockchain and decentralized ledger technology would “facilitate the development of the Nigerian digital economy.” Cointelegraph contacted the local blockchain ecosystem to understand how the industry and the community accept the policy. 

Olajide Abiola, the co-founder and CEO of KiaKia — a Nigerian fintech company — expressed delight at the development. Olajide said the blockchain technology policy can potentially impact various areas of governance and policy-making in Nigeria.

He further stated that if the blockchain policy is leveraged correctly, it could help manage digital identity, creating a tamper-proof digital identity for citizens to authenticate and access government services securely. With the proper regulations, blockchain technology could also impact e-payments and billings in Nigeria, Olajide stated.

Considering that the technology is yet to be imbibed into the day-to-day activities of Nigerians, businesses can reduce costs and improve cash flow by offering secure and transparent payment options, with consumers benefiting from faster and more convenient transactions. This increased efficiency and convenience can lead to increased economic activity and growth.

The Federal Executive Council, alongside approving the policy, instructed relevant regulatory bodies to create regulatory frameworks for implementing blockchain technology in different sectors of the economy.

Local blockchain expert Barnette Akomolafe from the crypto exchange app M7pay also spoke about how great of a milestone it is for governments to recognize the potential of blockchain technology. According to Akomolafe, governments can encourage innovation and investment in blockchain technology through policies and regulations. This move could lead to economic growth and job creation for Nigerian youth.

Binance’s West and East Africa director, Nadeem Anjarwalla, commented that through the approval of the policy, Nigeria is positioning itself as a nation ahead of the curve, thereby supporting further blockchain innovation, user protection, security and economic competitiveness in the long term.

Anjarwalla commended the comprehensive approach taken in the reviewed policy document based on the six key initiatives, which include the establishment of Nigeria’s blockchain consortium, strengthening of the regulatory and legal framework, the focus of the provision of national digital identity, promotion of blockchain digital literacy and awareness, the creation of blockchain business incentive programs, and establishment of a national blockchain sandbox for proof of concepts and pilot implementation.

Nigeria is known to be one of the world’s most curious nations about cryptocurrencies.

The price of new memecoin PEPE has plunged more than 42% only days after reaching its all-time high on May 6, leaving at least one investor with hundreds of thousands in paper losses.

According to blockchain analytics service Lookonchain, one crypto “whale” purchased 962.3 billion PEPE using 70 Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) and 470 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 for an average price of $0.000003122 on May 5.

PEPE has, however, fallen 42% from its all-time high since then, according to CoinGecko. The crypto investor’s PEPE holdings are now estimated to be worth only $2.4 million, marking an unrealized loss of more than $600,000.

Despite the recent price decline, PEPE still holds a market capitalization of just over $1 billion, making it the 45th-largest cryptocurrency by overall valuation.

Since its inception on April 14, PEPE has attracted widespread attention, witnessing over $636 million in trading volume within the last 24 hours, and single-handedly burning more than 5,000 ETH in related gas fees via Uniswap trading as of May 5.

While the memecoin has witnessed extreme volatility in its price, the number of individual holders has increased steadily over the past three weeks. According to data from Dune Analytics, there are 144,534 individual holders of tokens at the time of publication.

The advent of memecoin mania has also driven fees on the Bitcoin network to surge to their highest levels of the last two years, following an enormous spike in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20-related transactions.

Memecoins have played a role in the cryptocurrency industry since the creation of the most widely recognized meme-based cryptocurrency, Dogecoin

, back in 2013. It’s worth pointing out that due to the inherent lack of any fundamentals, investment in memecoins can be an incredibly risky trading strategy, with vast sums of wealth being made and obliterated in equal measure.

A sudden spike in Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 transaction fees and unconfirmed transactions sparked concern on Crypto Twitter over the weekend of a potential Denial of Service (DoS) “attack” on the network. 

Some Bitcoin analysts and commentators have been quick to allay these fears from their respective followers.

Bitcoin average transaction fees are currently $19.20, or 0.00068 BTC, according to BitInfoCharts. Meanwhile, according to Mempool Space, the backlog of transactions at time of writing stood at 459,341.

The increased demand on the network has even caused total fees per block to temporarily exceed the block subsidy reward of 6.25 BTC on May 7.

BITCOIN TRANSACTION FEES HAVE SURPASSED THE BLOCK SUBSIDY COINBASE REWARD

The proof-of-work mining process has a set block subsidy of 6.25 BTC, which halves every four years. However, in the rare instance that block space demand surges, this figure can be exceeded, causing higher transaction fees.

Industry analysts reported that it is the first time this has happened since 2017. Fees of 6.76 BTC were recorded for one block and block 788695 generated fees of 6.7 BTC.

The Mempool Space explorer shows that activity has since cooled down a little and fees have fallen back below the block reward again. The next block is expected to be processed generating 4.51 BTC in fees.

The surge in activity and block space demand has been attributed to the rise in Ordinals inscriptions. According to analytics provider Glassnode, a total of 75% of Bitcoin on-chain transactions used Taproot on May 7, resulting in a record high.

Some on Crypto Twitter, however, speculated that the recent congestion has resulted from a DoS (denial of service) attack on the Bitcoin network.

Bitcoin analysts quickly pointed out that it was due to demand rather than a premeditated attack. “0xfoobar” told his 130,000 followers:

“Bitcoin mempool finally gets some usage and the maxis are framing it as a DoS attack on the network. They really have not considered even the most basic scenarios, like ‘Bitcoin becomes popular and people are willing to pay to use it’”

On May 8, the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, suspended Bitcoin transactions again, citing “the large volume of pending transactions.” It is the second time that Binance has suspended BTC transactions in the past 12 hours.

Crypto exchange Binance halted Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 withdrawals for the second time on May 8, citing a large backlog of pending withdrawals.

Binance tweeted on May 8 that it closed off BTC withdrawals “temporarily” as there was a “large volume of pending transactions.”

It added the transactions were still pending, as its “set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in [Bitcoin] network gas fees.”

There is a large volume of withdrawal transactions from Binance still pending as our set fees did not anticipate the recent surge in $BTC network gas fees.

Our team is working to accelerate the confirmation of all pending transactions.

We'll provide updates here.

— Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023

The exchange provided an update almost two hours after its initial tweet and said it was ""replacing the pending [Bitcoin] withdrawal transactions with a higher fee so that they get picked up by mining pools.""

Nearly three hours after it's first tweet, Binance said Bitcoin withdrawals had resumed with pending transactions being processed with higher transaction fees.

It added it was working on enabling withdrawals via the Lightning Network which it claimed could help mitigate such withdrawal halts in the future.

To prevent a similar recurrence in the future, our fees have been adjusted. We will continue to monitor on-chain activity and adjust accordingly if needed.

Our team has also been working on enabling BTC Lightning Network withdrawals, which will help in such situations.

— Binance (@binance) May 8, 2023

Earlier on May 7, Binance also had to temporarily suspend Bitcoin withdrawals, claiming there was an overflow of transactions on the blockchain. It reopened withdrawals over an hour and a half later.

At the time, the Bitcoin mempool had a backlog of around 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed. That swelled to nearly 485,000 at the time of Binance's second withdrawal halt, according to data from mempool.space.

A mempool is an area where transactions on the Bitcoin network “wait” before being verified by each blockchain node.

Binance saw significant Bitcoin net negative outflows on May 7 with around 175,650 BTC worth around $4.95 billion flowing from the exchange on the day according to data from CryptoQuant.

Binance claimed this outflow data was actually it moving Bitcoin between its hot and cold wallets.

The price of Bitcoin has also fallen around 3.5% from its weekly high of over $29,700 on May 6, as per Cointelegraph data.

With memecoins having captured the attention of the wider crypto industry in recent weeks, a viral video has emerged detailing just how easy it is for anyone with an internet connection to create a brand new cryptocurrency from scratch.

A May 6 video from digital artist Johnny Shankman — who goes by whitelights.eth on Twitter — shows him completing a “speedrun” of creating and deploying an entirely new token, humorously dubbed “EASY_MONEY,” in just 27 seconds. The record was then beaten just a day later, clocking in at 22.45 seconds. 

The term “speed run” originates from the gaming community and is typically used in reference to completing a game, or level in a game, as quickly as possible. 

In the now-viral video, Shankman shows how any user can quickly create a new token by utilizing a program called Contracts Wizard, created by the crypto cybersecurity firm OpenZeppelin. The Contacts Wizard tool generates code for an ERC-20 token with a few quick clicks of a cursor. On the program, users can select a number of potential features for their token.

After the code has been created, Shankman then uses an application called Remix, which compiles the token’s smart contract and deploys it on a given blockchain network. In the video, Shankman opts for deploying his EASY_MONEY (EZ) token on the Ethereum testnet.

He notes in the comments section that the video was “for educational purposes only” and clarifies that by deploying EASY_MONEY on the Ethereum testnet, it is not a real token to be speculated on.

Notably, Shankman’s video was picked up by a number of large accounts on Crypto Twitter, being reposted by the likes of Loopifyyy, which has now seen the video gain more than 3 million views across a series of different accounts.

The viral popularity of Shankman’s post comes at a time where “shitcoins'' have gained drastically in popularity throughout the broader crypto ecosystem. The recent memecoin boom has been led in large part by an “entirely useless” frog-themed token called Pepe, which has seen its value surge more than 5,000% since its inception on April 14.

In a follow-up comment, Shankman pointed out that someone had actually created a token with the same name as his explainer but divulged that he “did not make it” and he would “not be buying it.”

Less than 24 hours later, a new video emerged from another account on Twitter, that showed the same process being completed in just 22.45 seconds, setting a new unofficial record for the memecoin speedrun.

 withdrawals on May 7 due to an alleged overflow of transactions on the Bitcoin network. 

The Bitcoin mempool was clogged with over 400,000 transactions waiting to be processed at the time of writing. The mempool is known as the “waiting area” for incoming transactions before they are verified independently by each node on the network.

Binance tweeted that BTC withdrawals had resumed after nearly an hour of halting. Outflows on the crypto exchange peaked on May 7, rising to $187 million, according to data from CryptoQuant.

Behind the congestion is believed to be a surge in BRC-20 transactions in the last few days due to memecoins like Pepe (PEPE). The memecoin trading hype drove Bitcoin transaction fees to their highest point in two years. On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping nearly 400% from late April, Cointelegraph reported.

Developed after Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard recently introduced that allows users to create and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. It is currently becoming a hot spot for meme tokens. 

CoinMarketCap’s data shows that PEPE’s price has climbed over 263% in the last week. As of writing, however, the memecoin is down over 7% following a 30% drop on May 6 as whales profited from Binance's recent listing. Crypto exchanges MEXC Global, Bitget, Gate.ioand Huobi listed PEPE trading pairs two weeks ago, kicking off the token hype.

Since the introduction of Dogecoin in 2013, memecoins have become a major part of the cryptocurrency world, making and ruining fortunes alike. Investopedia defines a memecoin as a cryptocurrency represented “with comical or animated memes, that [is] supported by enthusiastic online traders and followers.”

Big Four accounting firm Deloitte has integrated blockchain technology to allow customers to store verification credentials in a single digital wallet to streamline the “typically inefficient” verification processes.

In a May 4 statement, Deloitte announced it has integrated KILT Protocol technology — a Polkadot parachain — to enable the issuance of reusable digital credentials to its customers. The integration aims to improve the efficiency of Deloitte’s Know Your Customer (KYC) and Know Your Business (KYB) verification processes.

In the statement, Deloitte said the standard and “typically inefficient” processes, including KYC and KYB certificates being issued on paper, and identity verification requests requiring multiple data points when only one is needed, often create “extra work in the process.“

Additionally, these traditional verification procedures store data and personal information across multiple platforms and databases, placing consumer data privacy at risk. 

The credentials will serve various use cases, including regulatory compliance for banking and decentralized finance (DeFi), age verification for e-commerce, private logins and fundraising.

While the wallet will be stored on the customer’s device and remain under their control at all times, Deloitte retains the ability to modify if circumstances change, as noted in the statement:

“Credentials are digitally signed by Deloitte. Deloitte can revoke credentials using blockchain technology if conditions of the customer have changed after the credential was issued.”

The company added that no prior knowledge of blockchain is required from customers to set up the credential wallet.

Related: Deloitte dives into immersive experiences as more industries turn to Web3

KILT Protocol founder Ingo Rübe said that the streamlined identity solutions built on KILT allow customers to use verifiable digital credentials across multiple services while maintaining control “over when and where to share personal information.”

As a Polkadot parachain, it also provides the “scale and security needed by enterprise partners,” he added.

Polkadot tweeted shortly after the announcement on May 4, saying that Deloitte leveraging KILT’s solutions to support its KYC and KYB processes is vital for safeguarding itself against illegal activity.

This comes after reports on April 26 that there were over 300 crypto-related job opportunities available at Deloitte, with almost all of them being posted in the same week.

Meanwhile, searching for crypto-related job openings at the other Big Four accounting firms, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, showed no results.

A bot initiated the hack on BSC, which led to a more than $1.3 million loss. The attacker also targeted the Arbitrum network, with ARB/ETH deployments losing over $5 million. Twitter users claimed the token contract had a basic implementation error as the root cause.

The protocol confirmed the attack, paused all contracts and burned DEI tokens to prevent further damage. “We are currently in the process of comprehending the actual backing of DEI tokens,” said the Deus team on Twitter, adding that a “comprehensive recovery and redemption plan” will be created after a full analysis of the balances and snapshots.

DEI is used as a collateral mechanism for third-party instruments built on the Fantom protocol. Its price dropped 30% over the past 24 hours, data from CoinMarketCap shows. The stablecoin is trading at $0.20 at the time of writing, losing its $0.30 peg. Last year, the stablecoin also lost its $1 peg after the Terra collapse.

It is not the first time that Deus Finance has been hacked. The protocol was exploited in March 2022 in a flash-loan attack, resulting in over $3 million in losses in Dai

HOW TO
Join us on social networks

A transaction on the Ethereum blockchain is technically initiated by an external account owner (not a contract). For example, if User A sends 1 Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 to User B, the action of debiting from one account and crediting to another changes the blockchain’s state.

The change specifically takes place on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Ethereum transactions need to be broadcast to the entire network, and any node can broadcast a request for the execution of a transaction on the EVM.

After broadcasting the request, a validator can then execute the transaction and propagate the state change to the whole network. Transaction fees are incurred during the process of validation, and each transaction must be included in a validated block. There are different types of transactions on the Ethereum network:

Regular transactions: transactions occurring from one account to another.
Contract-execution transactions: transactions interacting with deployed smart contracts (the “to” address is a smart contract address).
Contract-deployment transactions: transactions with no “to” address (the data field is simply used to deploy the smart contract’s code).
How to check the status of an Ethereum transaction

Here’s a brief step-by-step guide on how to track Ethereum transactions:

Step 1: Select an Ethereum blockchain explorer

Some blockchain explorers are specific to Ethereum, such as Etherscan, Ethplorer and EthVM. Others support multiple chains, such as Blockchain.com and Tokenview, among others.

Step 2: Enter the transaction hash into the blockchain explorer’s search field

On Etherscan, for example, the search field is on the top, left-hand corner of the screen next to a dropdown that says “All Filters.” Depending on the tool, a user can search for information based on a wallet address, transaction hash (txid), block, token or domain name.

The txid is a unique identifier attached to a specific transaction. All transactions carried out on-chain, or those to and from external addresses, carry a unique txid found in the transaction details.

Depending on the platform, it can also be called a “hash” or “txn hash.” It usually looks like a string of random letters and numbers. On MetaMask, for example, a user can instantly see the txid upon clicking the “Activity” tab and selecting the transaction.

Other than the txid, traders can also use their public address (a string of 42 characters corresponding to their public account). In this case, they will be taken to an overview of their wallet activities, allowing them to navigate to the specific transaction independently.

Step 3: Click the icon for “search” or “enter” on the blockchain explorer

Step 4: Check if the transaction was successful or not

How to know if an ETH transaction was successful: Details indicating the state of the transaction will appear on the blockchain explorer. If the transaction was successfully validated and is now on the blockchain, it will say “success” or “successful.”

If there are no errors displayed, it means that the transaction was completed successfully. The ETH should be credited to the destination wallet or exchange account within 24 hours of sending.

In the event of an Ether transaction failure, on the other hand, several error messages can appear:

Error message or symbol: A red exclamation point or an error message saying “bad instruction” or “out of gas” means that the transaction was unsuccessful and the funds did not reach their intended destination. In the case of an “out of gas” error, users can double the gas limit they initially specified and try again.
Reverted: This pertains to a smart contract user error. It means that the user should double-check the details of the transaction.
Transaction not found: Either the transaction did not go through or it isn’t appearing on the blockchain explorer yet. Try using another explorer. If it still doesn’t appear on multiple ones, there’s a good chance it did not go through.
Pending: The transaction is still waiting to be validated or processed, but it was located in the explorer’s transaction pool. Sometimes pending transactions can still be canceled or replaced by a user.

How long does an Ethereum transaction take to process?

An average transaction on the Ethereum blockchain will typically take between 15 seconds and five minutes to process, depending on several factors. These include the amount paid to process it (transaction fee) and how busy the network is at the time of processing.

Ethereum transitioned from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake blockchain after the Merge. However, transaction speeds remain roughly the same. According to the Ethereum Foundation, it’s a common misconception that the Merge drastically sped up transactions.

However, there’s a slight difference, with slots occurring precisely every 12 seconds post-Merge compared with every 13.3 seconds pre-Merge. In any case, the change is barely noticeable by most users, as processing still usually depends on network congestion and transaction fees.

When a transaction is initiated, it is logged into Ethereum’s memory pool (mempool) and waits for validators to pick it up. The mempool functions much like a waiting room where pending transactions are held.

Once a validator enters transaction data into a block and adds the block to the blockchain, the transaction is considered complete. It is said to be finalized and irreversible after six additional blocks have been mined and added on top of it.

By checking a transaction’s status, traders can confirm whether their transaction has succeeded or failed and how many blocks have been created since their transaction was added to the chain.

Why should traders check a transaction’s status?

Ethereum participants must pay gas fees to use the network to transfer funds or deploy smart contracts. The fees largely depend on the number of participants waiting to execute transactions at a given time.

Network congestion and demand are thus directly proportional to transaction costs. When demand is high, costs rise — the opposite is true when demand is low. In any case, checking a transaction’s status helps a trader monitor the cost of using the network.

It can also help users determine if the gas fee they paid is sufficient to have their transaction confirmed. Low gas fees can usually truncate or delay transactions, leaving them to remain pending for long periods of time, especially during high network congestion.

Such transactions will remain pending until the gas fees reach the required minimum fees on the network. If this happens, a user can resend the transaction by resubmitting it and increasing the gas fee while ensuring it carries the same nonce.

In addition to transaction status, Ethereum blockchain explorers can also reveal the following helpful information:

Timestamp: the date and time the transaction was added to the blockchain.
Block confirmations: the number of blocks mined since the transaction was confirmed.
Transaction fee: the fee paid to the miner or validator.
ETH price: the price of ETH at the time of processing.
Base fee: the lowest fee required to transact on Ethereum.
Gas limit: the maximum amount of gas the sender is allocating to process the transaction.
Nonce: a unique number marking each transaction executed on a user’s wallet; it increases by one each time a new transaction is sent.

By being aware of the above, traders can stay on top of their ETH transactions and make sure transactions are processed correctly and quickly. This helps to ensure smooth Ethereum transactions when sending and receiving funds or deploying smart contracts. Understanding a transaction’s status can also help users adjust their spending habits and optimize network usage.

United States inflation and how it might affect the price of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,770

 are two of the top concerns on investors’ minds around the world. To illustrate, one prominent crypto personality bet big bucks on the future of the U.S. economy: the former Coinbase executive recently paid out $1.5 million to settle a Twitter wager about possible hyperinflation in the American economy.

The U.S. may not be experiencing hyperinflation, but the possibility of prices going out of control seems to concern the Federal Reserve. The Fed raised interest rates by a quarter-point on May 3 — to the highest level in 16 years — pushing the target range for its benchmark from 5% to 5.25%.

As inflation pressures continue, Bitcoin is still seen as a safe haven for many, with crypto firms weighing on the digital currency to fight back inflation and turmoil in mainstream finance.

This week’s Crypto Biz explores the latest wild wager on Bitcoin prices, inflation fears and the jobs that artificial intelligence may soon replace.

Balaji pays out his crazy $1 million Bitcoin bet, 97% under price target

A closely watched wager between former Coinbase chief technology officer Balaji Srinivasan and pseudonymous Twitter user James Medlock has been closed, with Srinivasan paying $1.5 million to settle. The wager commenced on March 17 when Medlock offered to bet anyone $1 million that the United States would not experience hyperinflation. A few hours later, the former Coinbase executive accepted the bet, claiming that an impending crisis would lead to the deflation of the U.S. dollar and, thus, to a hyperinflation scenario, taking the BTC price to $1 million. As part of the deal, Srinivasan paid Medlock $500,000, donated $500,000 to Bitcoin core developers and gave an additional $500,000 to the nonprofit charity, Give Directly.

MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin conviction ‘strong’ as it posts Q1 profit

The Bitcoin investment strategy is as strong as ever at business intelligence platform MicroStrategy after the company posted its first quarterly profit since 2020. The firm returned to the green with a profit of $94 million, primarily attributed to a one-time income tax benefit of $453.2 million. The firm further reduced its leverage by repaying a $161 million Bitcoin-backed loan from the now-collapsed Silverage Bank. The quarterly results were also impacted by a revenue rise of 2.2% from last year to $121.9 million. MicroStrategy’s CEO Phong Lee said the firm would continue to execute its dual strategy of growing business intelligence software and acquiring Bitcoin. The firm believes its Bitcoin thesis is a “pretty good way to outperform the market.” 

Coinbase stock will be ‘weighed down’ until US rules are clear: Citi

Coinbase’s stock price will continue to be “weighed down” until regulators establish the legal “rules of the road” in the United States, Citi analysts say. The bank downgraded shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and lowered its price target, citing “too many unknowns” as the company battles it out with regulators. However, bearish sentiment on Coinbase’s stock is not stopping investment firm ARK Invest from increasing its exposure to the crypto exchange. ARK purchased 168,869 Coinbase shares for its exchange-traded funds on May 1, worth nearly $8.5 million. In April, ARK bagged 304,300 shares worth $17.5 million. Previously, the firm bought 2.4 million shares in March for about $117 million.

Citi's analysis was published prior to Coinbase's Q1 earnings report released on May 4.

7,800 jobs at IBM could be replaced by AI within years, CEO suggests

IBM is expecting to put a “pause” on hiring for “back-office” roles that could be potentially automated by artificial intelligence instead. According to the company CEO, Arvind Krishna, back-office positions, such as those in human resources and accounting departments, will likely be the first to be automated by AI. Nearly 30% of these positions will “easily” be replaced by AI over five years, claimed Krishna in an interview. IBM employs 282,000 employees globally, according to LinkedIn data. Non-customer-facing staff sits at nearly 26,000. 

Before you go: The average person’s wealth will be ‘completely destroyed by inflation,' says Arthur Hayes

The majority of people will have their wealth progressively eaten away by the devaluation of money, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and former CEO of crypto derivatives exchange BitMEX. He believes the world’s largest economies will be forced to inflate away the sizeable public debt accumulated in the past years through money printing. With long-term inflation on the horizon, Hayes’s investment thesis focuses on preserving wealth through investing in digital assets.

April saw several hacks, exploits and rug pulls that resulted in a net loss of over $100 million among several DeFi protocols.

Amid the growing memecoin frenzy, the chances of exploits have increased multifold, with WallStreetBets — a popular trading sub-Reddit group — allegedly rugging its users for $635,000 just days after airdropping about $15,000.

DeFi protocol Level Finance was a victim of an exploit resulting in the loss of nearly $1 million. The attacker manipulated a “claim multiple” bug in a Level Finance smart contract to steal more than 214,000 native Level Finance (LVL) tokens from the exchange.

The volume of liquid staking protocols has dramatically risen in the past couple of weeks, overtaking decentralized exchanges (DEXs). From April 13 to May 1, the total value locked (TVL) on decentralized exchanges declined by $1.66 billion, while it increased on liquid staking protocols by $280 million.

Liquid staking solutions now have more TVL than DEXs: DefiLlama

Liquid staking solutions like Lido and Rocket Pool now have a higher total value locked than DEXs, making them the top category of DeFi protocols according to data from the crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, $17.19 billion of crypto was locked in liquid staking contracts, compared with $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion.

April’s crypto scams, exploits and hacks lead to $103 million lost — CertiK

Crypto exploits, exit scams and flash loan attacks did not let up in April, with more than $103 million of funds stolen from crypto projects and investors. On April 30, crypto security and auditing firm CertiK posted an April roundup of crypto exploits, scams and hacks, revealing total funds lost was $103.7 million, bringing total year-to-date losses to $429.7 million.

The month was marred with significant crypto exploits, with $25.4 million lost due to an exploit of several maximal extractable value trading bots on April 3, $22 million stolen in a hot wallet exploit at the Bitrue exchange, and the $13 million hack of South Korean GDAC exchange.

WallStreetBets mod dumps memecoin worth $635,000 in alleged rug pull

A moderator of the popular trading subreddit r/WallStreetBets has dumped a large portion of WSB Coin (WSB), a token project claiming to be the official memecoin of Wall Street Bets.

On May 2, WSB was launched by people involved in moderating the WallStreetBets Reddit forum. The subreddit gained notoriety for the GameStop short squeeze, which sent hedge funds to their knees in January 2021. The creators of the WSB token claimed that there would be no allocation for the team and that 10% of the coins would be reserved for the subreddit.

RFK Jr. elaborates position on CBDC, crypto: ‘It isn’t just criminals who want privacy’

The U.S. presidential candidate has added anti-CBDC to his anti-establishment, anti-vaccination repertoire and has gained double-digit support among Democrats.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is challenging United States President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination in the 2024 presidential election, has taken to Twitter again to share more of his thoughts on cryptocurrency.

Kennedy criticized Biden on May 2 for calling the U.S. banking system “safe and sound” the previous day. “Today, bank stocks are crashing. The American people deserve more than glib assurances and perception management,” he tweeted.

On May 3, Kennedy condemned the Biden administration’s proposed tax on crypto mining. An environmental lawyer, Kennedy called the proposed 30% tax on energy used by crypto miners “a bad idea.” He said mining’s energy use was “a concern (though somewhat overstated),” and continued:

“The environmental argument is a selective pretext to suppress anything that threatens elite power structures. Bitcoin, for example.”

Jumping to “control” of cryptocurrency, Kennedy found more anti-establishment fodder. “It isn’t just criminals who want privacy,” he said. “Governments harass their enemies and crush dissent by controlling bank accounts and payment platforms.”

Related: Bitcoin at the barricades: Ottawa, Ukraine and beyond

Kennedy developed the theme of financial control further the following day with a look back at the Canadian truckers’ anti-vaccination protests in Ottawa in 2022. The Canadian government locked the bank accounts of people supporting the protesters. Kennedy said:

“It’s not outlandish to imagine that even here in America, your bank account could one day be frozen because of your politics, or comments you’ve made on social media.”

After all, he said, GoFundMe blocked U.S. accounts from supporting the Canadian truckers and planned to redirect the donations to other charities. Meanwhile, PayPal imposed fines on users for spreading “what they deemed to be misinformation.” Both of those decisions were successfully challenged under pressure, but Kennedy saw the hand of big government behind them anyway. “Often those private companies are acting out of fear of Congress or regulators, or directly at their bidding,” he claimed.

Please learn the difference, RFK Jr. ✌️https://t.co/Y5EHShNPFA

— Wicked (@w_s_bitcoin) May 3, 2023

“That is why I oppose CBDCs [central bank digital currencies], which will vastly magnify the government’s power to suffocate dissent by cutting off access to funds with a keystroke,” Kennedy concluded.

Kennedy first voiced his opposition to CBDCs in a somewhat confused tweet relating to the FedNow instant payment system.

I am voting for whomever is procrypto

if anyone is offended by this it means you hate liberty, entrepreneurism, small businesses and the underdogs

— Wendy O (@CryptoWendyO) May 3, 2023

According to CNN on April 29, Kennedy has 19% support among Democrats. He shares his distrust of CBDCs with several Republican politicians, such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seen as a possible challenger to candidate Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.

In addition to Kennedy, writer Marianne Williamson has declared her intention to challenge Biden for the U.S. presidency. She implied dismay at the Canadian government’s blocking of bank accounts and crypto wallets in a tweet at the time and holds that “our government has become a handmaiden to a new corporate order,” but does not mention cryptocurrency on her campaign website.

The French bank BNP Paribas is collaborating with the Bank of China (BOC) to promote China’s digital currency, the digital yuan, to its corporate clients, the South China Morning Post reported.

The partnership will enable BNP Paribas China’s corporate clients to connect with the BOC system, allowing users to manage their digital yuan wallets by linking them to their bank accounts, track transactions and make payments using China’s digital currency via an e-CNY management system. The management system also promises to make it easier and more convenient for clients to use digital cash for real-time transactions.

The digital yuan management system can facilitate “efficient, real-time and convenient [digital cash] practice,” BNP shared, according to The South China Morning Post. 

BNP Paribas China also plans to explore the use of China’s central bank digital currency (CBDC) in other areas, such as smart contracts, supply chain finance, utility and cross-border payments.

To promote the adoption of its CBDC, China handed out millions of dollars worth of digital yuan across the country during the Lunar New Year period. A number of cities reportedly gave away over 180 million yuan, amounting to $26.5 million worth of CBDCs in programs such as subsidies and consumption coupons.

In April, local news reported that the Chinese city of Changshu notified all civil servants within its jurisdiction that they would be paid their full salaries in digital yuan starting in May 2023. The payment terms apply to all civil servants in the public service and other state-owned units in the city. 

Despite the Chinese government’s efforts to promote the digital yuan, Hong Kong residents have not shown much enthusiasm for the government’s drive to promote the adoption of its CBDC. During the first four days of the hard launch of the digital yuan wallet, only 625 residents signed up, indicating a lukewarm response to the new digital currency offering.

South Korean authorities are seeking the extradition of the co-founder and former CEO of Terraform Labs, Do Kwon. The prosecutor overseeing the investigation believes his repatriation would best serve the victims of the TerraUSD (USTC) and LUNA token collapses, The Wall Street Journal reported.

South Korea is the place where most of the crimes Kwon is accused of took place, according to Dan Sung-han, leader of the South Korean prosecutors investigating the crash of the two cryptocurrencies, which erased nearly $40 billion from the Terra ecosystem.

“Given the nature of this incident, we think investigating the case in South Korea would be the most efficient way of bringing justice [to investors]”, the prosecutor said in an interview with the newspaper.

Kwon, also a South Korean citizen, was arrested in Montenegro in March and indicted on document forgery charges. Since then, authorities from the United States and South Korea have made efforts to extradite the Terra co-founder. He is also wanted by regulatory authorities in Singapore.

During a press conference after Kwon’s arrest, Montenegrin Justice Minister Marko Kovač said that a decision on his extradition would be based on “several factors,"" including the severity of the criminal offense as well as the location and time of the offense. Montenegro reportedly has no extradition treaty with either Singapore or South Korea. However, it has an old extradition agreement with the U.S. and has previously extradited American citizens.

In late April, South Korean officials indicted Shin Hyun-seong, also a co-founder of Terraform Labs, along with nine other individuals for the collapse of the Terra ecosystem on charges of fraud, breach of trust and embezzlement.

Prosecutors accused the individuals of earning illicit profits of nearly 460 billion Korean won ($350 million), the Korean daily KBS World reported. Kwon would face similar charges if extradited to his home country, Sung-han told the Journal, with a jail term of up to 40 years.

Terra was one of the earliest crypto firms that popularized the concept of algorithmic stablecoins. The ecosystem collapsed when its native stablecoin, USTC, depegged from the U.S. dollar in May 2022, triggering a snowball crisis in the crypto industry last year.

In recent years, emerging technologies have been pervasive in many major industries around the world, whether it’s blockchain technology used to help combat climate change or artificial intelligence (AI) projected to drive economic growth.

At the Metaverse Entertainment Worlds (MEWS) conference in Monaco, Cointelegraph sat down with Stephen Castell to discuss how emerging technologies are creating new ethics, changing the game for banks and more.

Castell is an expert witness in class-action lawsuits in the United States, has a Ph.D. in mathematics, and has been recently involved in major lawsuits involving crypto giants, such as Voyager and Binance.

Cointelegraph editor-in-chief Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr in conversation with Dr. Stephen Castell at MEWS 2023.

The legal expert began the talk by highlighting trust as a foundational theme in the emerging tech space. He tied trust to the recent banking crisis in the U.S. and commented that this was also a “fundamental idea of a bank” at its conception.

However, banks now “basically run on a bad business model,” he said. He pointed out that although the crypto community has visions to revolutionize the financial system through technological innovation, there needs to be regulation.

“Just because it’s crypto is different, there still are laws to protect investors, which govern crypto investments as much as they do any other potential investment.”

When it comes to emerging technologies like AI, Castell predicts that banks will be at the “forefront” of the adoption of such technology. 

“The banks are going to try and do it for the benefit of themselves,” he said. “To be safe, to have safe money, to have good investments, not to lose, not to go bust, not to solve the conundrum of what they do on a bank run.”

Castell continued to point out that, aside from benefiting banks, the introduction of AI into humanity will cause the “democratization and commoditization of intelligence.”

“It means that any human on the planet, maybe even some animals, too, can be just as intelligent and as creative as the most intelligent and most creative person that there’s ever been.”

He suggested that humans will need to be “socialized” with AI and other emerging technologies like the metaverse in order for it to be useful. 

“It’s still going to do something for us — useful, valuable, exciting, productive. It’s got to do all of those things if it’s going to become generic.”

AI has had no scarcity in use cases since it skyrocketed in popularity among the general public in recent months. Lawmakers in the United Kingdom are looking at the technology to be used as a tool for economic growth. 

In the crypto space, exchanges are implementing AI-based chatbots to help educate users on everything from industry news to token prices and events.

“I really hope that all the new technologies that we’re talking about actually will create new ethics for this new human species that we are.”

Castell believes that what is being seen now in the emerging tech space is just the beginning of what he called the “cyborgization” of humans.

As concerns about climate change and environmental sustainability continue to grow, many organizations are turning to innovative solutions to help address these issues. One such solution is blockchain technology, which has the potential to revolutionize sustainability efforts across a variety of industries.

On April 25, a World Economic Forum (WEF) white paper featured blockchain as a tool to fight climate change. The white paper highlighted the benefits of using blockchains in the climate action community. From improving market transparency to democratizing access to climate action, the WEF wrote about various benefits of using blockchain in sustainability efforts.

To further explore blockchain’s potential in sustainability, Cointelegraph reached out to industry executives to get their knowledge on how blockchain can combat greenwashing, how it’s currently being used in environmental efforts, and the long-term benefits it offers to the world of climate action.

Solving the “greenwashing” problem

Greenwashing — deceptive advertising making products seem more sustainable than they are — has gained notoriety in the past few years. In one survey, 68% of executives in the United States admitted that their firms are guilty of greenwashing. 

According to Daniela Barbosa, the executive director of Hyperledger Foundation, the problem lies with verifying if a company that claims to be “green” is genuinely adhering to its professed sustainability plans and goals. 

The executive believes it’s necessary to set up a system that tracks and records these things. She highlighted that digital ledger technology (DLT) is the right tool for the job. Barbosa explained:

“With the inherent transparency and immutability of DLT, companies and whole industries can capture and document transactions such as carbon credits or sustainable sourcing throughout their operations, creating new credibility to sustainability claims.” 

Barbosa believes that trustworthy record-keeping systems will incentivize businesses to adopt sustainable practices, which will help them achieve climate goals and build consumer trust.

Meanwhile, Chia Network CEO and president Gene Hoffman also echoed Barbosa’s sentiments. According to Hoffman, the current infrastructure of carbon markets is restrictive and not conducive to innovation throughout the value chain. As a result, companies are limited in their ability to be transparent about sustainability efforts across the entire organization.

Blockchain’s current use in sustainable initiatives

The days of companies pretending to be sustainable and environmentally friendly may soon end because of blockchain technology and DLTs. Blockchain has already penetrated various initiatives by prominent organizations across the globe. 

“There is a growing range of applications leveraging DLT and related technologies, including green finance, sustainability reporting, climate accounting and supply chain traceability,” Barbosa told Cointelegraph.

The executive highlighted efforts like Genesis 2.0, a collaboration between the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the United Nations Climate Change Global Innovation Hub. The project involved two prototypes for digitizing bonds with future carbon benefits included in their value. These were tracked, delivered and transferred using blockchain, smart contracts and other related technologies.

Apart from this, Barbosa also highlighted how the government of the Canadian province of British Columbia launched the Energy and Mines Digital Trust pilot, which is building verifiable sustainability reporting. The project uses blockchain to protect its data and information. 

Additionally, Hoffman sees the Climate Action Data Trust (CADT) as the most impactful climate initiative utilizing blockchain technology. The CADT aims to establish trust in carbon credit-related data among multilateral and governmental organizations.

Although Web3 natives are not leading it, the initiative utilizes a public distributed ledger technology to address the issue of fostering internal cooperation among equal peers.

Furthermore, Hoffman also emphasized the significance of the Carbon Opportunities Fund, which builds on the foundation of the CADT. The project provides a reliable means for transparently sourcing carbon credits directly from project developers with end-to-end transparency. This approach enhances efficiency and transparency in climate markets that were previously opaque, according to Hoffman.

Long-term benefits of using blockchain in sustainability efforts

As blockchain gets more adoption in the climate action space, the industry could reap more of its long-term benefits, according to the executives. Victor Genin, the senior solution architect at BNB Chain, believes that ensuring compliance is one of the best benefits of using blockchain in the sustainability sector. 

Genin explained that blockchains could provide a means to track goods, services and resources across the supply chain. “This creates an opportunity to monitor environmental compliance and ensure that sustainable practices are followed throughout the entire lifecycle of a product or service,” he added.

Genin highlighted that there are other benefits, such as “increased transparency and accountability, traceability, energy efficiency, waste reduction and collaborative approaches.”

Despite all the benefits blockchain can bring, Hoffman believes it’s still not a “magical solution.” However, the executive believes that when designed and implemented responsibly, blockchain technology can serve as the foundation or framework for achieving greater transparency, accountability and security in climate action efforts.

Memecoin hype drives Bitcoin transaction fees to multi-year highs

Despite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels.

The ongoing trading frenzy of memecoins like Pepe Coin (PEPE) has triggered an unwanted consequence for Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

 — driving its transaction costs to multi-year highs.

Bitcoin transaction fees surged in early May, reaching their highest point over the past two years, according to data from Crypto Fees.

On May 3, the total amount of fees paid on the Bitcoin blockchain reached $3.5 million, jumping about 400% from late April. The average Bitcoin transaction fee reached as much as $7.2, according to YCharts.

The latest increase in BTC transaction fees is primarily attributed to a surge in Bitcoin activity involving BRC-20 transactions. According to data from Galaxy Research, 50% of all Bitcoin transactions on May 2 were related to BRC-20 transactions.

Modeled after Ethereum’s ERC-20 token standard, BRC-20 is an experimental token standard allowing users to issue and transfer fungible tokens on the Bitcoin blockchain. The standard was introduced in March 2023 by a pseudonymous on-chain analyst known as Domo.

The BRC-20 token standard has quickly become a major trend in the cryptocurrency industry, specifically amid the sharp growth of the PEPE memecoin. The token has rallied more than 600% over the past seven days, reaching its all-time high of $0.00000216 on May 5.

The Bitcoin blockchain isn’t the only blockchain affected by the ongoing memecoin hype. Gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain have also been skyrocketing to new multi-month highs recently.

On May 2, ETH transaction fees hit an aggregate amount of more than $19 million, a level not seen since May 2022, according to Crypto Fees. The Ethereum blockchain remains the most expensive network in terms of transaction fees at the time of writing.

Despite the latest spike in Bitcoin transaction fees, the current BTC transaction cost is still far from all-time high levels. The highest Bitcoin transaction fees were recorded in April 2021, when the average BTC transaction cost almost reached $70 amid a major decline in the Bitcoin network hash rate. The previous highest point in BTC transaction fees was in 2017, with transaction costs surging above $60.

In the United States, the White House released the national standards strategy for key and emerging technologies on May 4, identifying eight technology sectors that will have a significant economic impact in the near future.

Among the eight technologies are artificial intelligence, communication and network technologies, biotechnology and semiconductors, with the inclusion of distributed ledger technology (DLT) and digital identity infrastructure grabbing the crypto community’s attention.

DLT permits concurrent access, record validation and record updating throughout a networked database. Blockchain technology is based on DLT, making it possible for users to see any changes and the people who made them, lowering the need for auditing data, ensuring data reliability, and restricting access to only those who actually need it.

The national strategy aims to increase U.S. leadership in the development of international standards for these emerging technologies. The U.S. government is actively involved in building synergies with the private sector to promote and build international standards for such emerging technologies.

The most prominent example of such collaboration is the development of the telecom and communications standard. For example, the initial proposal for 3G was made in the 1990s by Qualcomm Technologies, with the subsequent recommendation for LTE — the dominant standard for wireless broadband communication for mobile devices and data terminals — made in the 2000s by NTT Docomo, a major Japanese mobile phone provider.

The national strategy suggests the likes of DLT and digital infrastructure would increasingly impact and be widely used in the economic sector. Some key areas where these technologies will be actively tested include automated and connected infrastructure, such as smart communities and the Internet of Things. DLT can especially find great use in building cybersecurity and privacy-based features and services.

Anyone who has dealt with trading in traditional finance is likely to be aware of profit and loss (PnL). But is PnL in the cryptocurrency world the same? The ability to comprehend terms like mark-to-market (MTM), realized PnL and unrealized PnL will help develop a better understanding of the cryptocurrency a person holds.

Without a well-defined process to get insight into profit or loss, cryptocurrency trading may be overwhelming, and traders may struggle with what they are doing. PnL reflects the change in the value of a trader’s positions over a specific period. 

To gain a clearer understanding, let's examine it in the context of cryptocurrency trading.

Understanding the basics of PnL

PnL in crypto refers to the calculation of the profit or loss made on a cryptocurrency investment or trading position. It is a metric used to evaluate the financial performance of a trader or investor in the crypto market.

To begin, here are some key terms in PnL terminology:

MTM

MTM refers to the process of valuing an asset or financial instrument based on its current market price or fair value. For example, in the context of crypto trading, if an investor holds a certain amount of Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

, the value of that Bitcoin will fluctuate based on the current market price.

The general formula for calculating PnL is:

Suppose the MTM price for Ether 

ETH

$1,854

 today is $1,970, while the MTM price yesterday was $1,950. In this case, the PnL is $20. It indicates a profit of $20. On the contrary, if the MTM price of ETH was $1,980 yesterday, it indicates a loss of $10.

Future value

Future value indicates the value of a digital coin at a future point in time.

For example, if a trader stakes Tron 

TRX

$0.0692

 worth $1,000 with a 4% yearly reward, how much will the person get back after a year? The answer is $1,040. At the time of staking, the present value will be $1,000, while the future value will be $1,040.

There will be a present value at the point when the trader stakes, but if the person considers the future as a whole, there could be countless future values.

There is a different way to use future value as well. Traders could ask how much to stake to get $1,040 in a year. If they know the present and future values, they could calculate the discount factor. The formula for calculating the discount factor is:

For the example given above, the discount factor will be:

Realized PnL

Realized PnL is calculated after traders have closed their position (sold the cryptocurrency they hold). Only the executed price of the orders is taken into account in realized PnL, and it has no direct relation to the mark price.

The mark price is the price at which a derivatives contract is valued based on the current market price of the underlying asset rather than the price at which the contract is being traded.

The formula for realized PnL is:

An example will help understand how to calculate realized PnL. If the entry price for buying X number of Polkadot 

DOT

$5.36

 is $70 and the exit price is $105, the PnL for the period is $35, which refers to a profit of $35. However, if the closing price of the trade was $55, the PnL will be $15, but it will reflect a loss.

Unrealized PnL

Unrealized PnL refers to the profit or loss that is currently held in open positions but has not yet been realized through closing the position. The formula for determining unrealized PnL is:

Donald has purchased ETH contracts with an average entry price of $1,900. The mark price of ETH is currently $1,600. The unrealized PnL for Donald is the difference between the average entry price and the mark price.

Unrealized PnL = $1,900 - $1,600 = $300

How to do PnL calculation

To determine PnL in cryptocurrency, a trader needs to find the difference between the initial cost of acquiring a digital coin and the current market value of the same coin. Various methods to calculate PnL in cryptocurrency are as follows:

First-in, first-out (FIFO) method

The FIFO method requires the seller to use the price of the asset from when it was first bought. Here is the process to calculate PnL using the FIFO method:

1) To settle on the initial cost of the cryptocurrency, multiply the purchase price per unit by the number of units sold.

2) To determine the current market value of the asset disposed of, multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

3) To find the PnL, deduct the initial cost from the current market value.

Suppose Bob first bought 1 ETH at $1,100 and a few days later bought 1 ETH at $800. A year later, he sold 1 ETH at $1,200. As he had first bought ETH at $1,100, this price will be considered the initial cost. Applying the FIFO method, Bob could calculate PnL as follows:

Bob's initial cost = (1 ETH x $1,100) = $1,100

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $1,100 = $100 (profit)

Last-in, first-out (LIFO) method

The LIFO method requires the seller to use the most recent purchase price of an asset in the calculation. The other aspects are just like the FIFO method. Here is the PnL using the LIFO method using the same example as above:

Bob’s initial cost = (1 ETH x $800) = $800

Current market value = (1 ETH x $1,200) = $1,200

PnL = $1,200 - $800 = $400 (profit)

Weighted average cost method

The weighted average cost method requires traders to determine the average cost of all units of a digital currency in their portfolio to arrive at the initial cost. Here are the steps to calculate PnL using this method:

1) Determine the total cost of all units of the cryptocurrency. Multiply the purchase price per unit for each transaction by the number of units of the asset and add the numbers.

2) To arrive at the weighted average cost per unit of the digital coin, divide the total cost of all units by the number of units.

3) Find the current market value of the cryptocurrency sold. Multiply the current market price per unit by the number of units sold.

4) To determine PnL, subtract the average cost per unit from the current market value.

Suppose Alice bought 1 BTC at $1,500 and a few days later bought 1 BTC at $2,000. She later sold 1 BTC at $2,400. Here is the PnL using the weighted average cost method:

Total cost = (1 BTC x $1,500) + (1 BTC x $2,000) = $3,500

Weighted average cost = $3,500 / 2 BTC = $1,750

Current market value = (1 BTC x $2,400) = $2,400

PnL = $2,400 - $1,750 = $650 (profit)

Profits/losses from opening and closing positions

Analyzing open and closed positions at regular intervals is an efficient way to monitor performance. An initial purchase a person makes in the market is an open position, while selling the cryptocurrency is termed closing the position. If a trader buys 10 DOT, it is an open position. When the trader sells those DOT, the position gets closed.

For example, if a trader bought 10 DOT for $70 and sold them for $100, the person’s PnL would be $30 ($100 - $70). Regular analysis of trades in line with open and closed positions helps a person trade in an organized manner.

Year-to-date (YTD) calculation

YTD is a way to measure the performance of investments made in cryptocurrency from the start of the year to the current date. Investors who regularly buy and hold cryptocurrencies for years can know their unrealized profits with a YTD calculation. The trader just needs to calculate the value of the portfolio at the beginning and end of a year and compare these values. This could be a calendar year or fiscal year, depending on the person’s preference or requirements.

Suppose someone holds $1,000 worth of Cardano 

ADA

$0.365

 on Jan. 1, 2022 and $1,600 of ADA on Jan. 1, 2023. In this case, $600 is the unrealized profit. Unrealized profit denotes returns that haven’t yet been converted into cash or cash equivalents such as term deposits.

Transaction-based calculation

A transaction-based calculation requires a person to calculate the PnL for each specific transaction. For instance, if a person bought 1 ETH for $1,000 and sold it for $1,500, the PnL for the transaction would be $500 profit ($1,500 - $1,000). If the number of transactions is small and a trader needs to calculate PnL for these transactions separately, a transaction-based calculation is an ideal method.

Percentage profit

The percentage profit method reflects the PnL as a percentage of the initial cost. An example will help understand better. Suppose a trader buys 1 Binance Coin 

BNB

$313

 for $300 and sells it for $390. In this case, the person’s PnL would be $90 profit ($390 - $300). To arrive at the percentage profit, the trader needs to divide the PnL by the purchase price and multiply the amount by 100 (($90 / $300) x 100). This amounts to 30%.

However, please note that these are simplified examples that do not factor in variables such as taxes, trading fees paid to the platform, market volatility, etc. In real-life situations, a trader will need to take into account the specific context when calculating PnL.

How to calculate PnL of perpetual contracts

Perpetual contracts are a type of futures contract with no fixed settlement time or expiration date. Traders can hold their long or short positions indefinitely, provided they have sufficient maintenance margin, which is the minimal amount of collateral needed for maintaining open trading positions.

When traders calculate the PnL of perpetual contracts in cryptocurrencies, they need to calculate both realized and unrealized PnL and then add them to determine the total PnL.

Here are the steps to measure PnL of perpetual contracts:

Again, this is a simplified way to explain the concept of calculating PnL for crypto perpetual contracts. When calculating total PnL in real life, a trader needs to take into account factors like trading fees and funding rates.

PnL calculations and associated tools

Understanding crypto PnL helps people know if their cryptocurrency portfolio is in profit or in loss. Gaining an insight into key parameters like cost basis, quantity, price of each trade and profitability of the portfolio helps traders assess the efficiency of their strategies and make necessary adjustments. Precise knowledge of the funds they have made or lost on a particular trade influences their upcoming trading decisions for the better.

Apart from PnL calculations, there are tools like specialized spreadsheets and automated trading bots that could help traders analyze their performances and zero in on profitable trading opportunities, regardless of their experience.

Consensus, the annual crypto and blockchain conference, attracted over 15,000 attendees, 220 sponsors and 410 speakers to its 2023 edition in Austin, Texas, despite recent regulatory struggles around cryptocurrency adoption in the United States. 

The turnout at Consensus 2023 demonstrated that U.S.-based companies and international organizations are still very much interested in implementing Web3 technology into their business models.

Caitlin Long, founder and CEO of Custodia Bank — a Wyoming-based digital asset bank — told Cointelegraph that the conference attracted serious ecosystem participants, saying, “We’ve seen during crypto winters before where Consensus gets overrun with high time preference people and companies (for example, multiple Lambo’s parked out front of the New York Hilton in 2018), and in bust years the low-time preference people and companies just keep building. This year was the latter.”

Businesses discuss Web3 strategies

Several large organizations were present at Consensus 2023, with Mastercard, Google, Robinhood and Coinbase, among others, gathering to discuss their Web3 strategies.

James Tromans, head of Web3 at Google Cloud, told Cointelegraph about some blockchain-based initiatives the company has recently launched.

“At the end of last year, Google Cloud announced Blockchain Node Engine, which allows users and developers to run an Ethereum node without having to manage or support it themselves,” he said.

At Consensus, the firm announced that it had expanded support for the Blockchain Node Engine to Polygon proof-of-stake, in addition to Ethereum.

Tromans added that Google Cloud knows what Polygon has been doing in the zero-knowledge (ZK) space, noting that Polygon ZK Ethereum virtual machines (zkEVM) and Polygon supernets will benefit from the provision of Google Cloud’s infrastructure and developer tools.

Moreover, Tromans pointed out that Google Cloud’s startup program will help onboard companies interested in building on Web3 using existing Google Cloud products. “Polygon is an important part of this initiative, as they have provided a $3 million contribution from their venture fund to get this off the ground with us,” he said.

Global financial services giant Mastercard announced its “Mastercard Crypto Credential” solution during Consensus. Raj Dhamodharan, head of crypto and blockchain at Mastercard, stated during a fireside discussion at Consensus that he is “excited about the underlying potential of blockchain technology” due to its ability to store and move value seamlessly.

However, Dhamodharan explained that “this potential is not fully realized today,” so Mastercard has started working on several products like Mastercard Crypto Credential.

“I believe that once you have the right building blocks necessary for safety and simplicity, you can have more businesses building and relying on the basic utility of storing and moving value,” Dhamodharan said on stage.

Conversations continued at side events

While there were 10 dedicated stages for 285 panels during Consensus, many side events allowed important conversations to continue outside of the conference.

For example, zero-knowledge proofs (ZK-proofs) were widely discussed at Consensus, but in-depth conversations around ZK-proofs took place at the “ZK360” event hosted by Mina Protocol. Evan Shapiro, CEO of the Mina Foundation and co-founder of the Mina Protocol, told Cointelegraph that the goal of ZK360 was for attendees to learn about the latest advancements in ZK-proofs and how these can be applied in the real world. “Web3 needs both privacy and verified computation. ZK-proofs provide both of those at a time when applications are needing these features to be more effective, decentralized and scalable,” he said.

Other layer-1 blockchain networks like Ripple and Algorand hosted side events, allowing Consensus attendees to better understand specific blockchain offerings while networking with community members. These events also presented an opportunity for non-Consensus attendees to learn about important topics within the Web3 sector. 

Lacking an international presence

While the turnout during Consensus 2023 was notable, some industry experts highlighted that the conference lacked an international presence.

Yat Siu, chairman of Animoca Brands — a venture capital company focused on blockchain-based games — told Cointelegraph that regions in Asia like Japan and Hong Kong are offering a progressive and welcoming regulatory environment for crypto adoption. He noted that most people he spoke with at Consensus seemed surprised or even skeptical at this. He said:

“I think that a larger presence of overseas participants would have helped allow Consensus participants to better understand the scope of excitement and opportunity that exists outside of the United States. I would love to see a stronger international presence at Consensus next year.”

Despite this, Siu said that Consensus 2023 was a well-attended, high-energy conference overall. “I was surprised at the level of deal-making activity that was taking place, even if the narrative was that the U.S. was negative on crypto,” he said.

Echoing Siu was Keith Grossman, president of enterprise at MoonPay. He told Cointelegraph that he was impressed to see so many executives from some of the largest companies in attendance at Consensus. “Deals were being discussed, and I believe we will look back at Consensus 2023 recognizing it represented a maturation in the industry as it relates to how Web3 technologies can be deployed in a meaningful manner for businesses and their customers.”

Matt Leisinger started his carrier in the traditional finance sector and shifted to trading cryptocurrencies in 2016. Leisinger invested in the Ethereum ecosystem and contributed to projects providing liquid staking services. Leisinger explains liquid staking as allowing users to stake assets on the blockchain and mint a receipt token that represents the staked assets, which maintains liquidity while users earn rewards and secure the network.

As institutional investment in cryptocurrency skyrockets, some are looking at ways to add staking to their portfolio. According to Leisinger, most of these firms would naturally choose liquid staking, but hurdles around Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering requirements, transparency, tokenholder privileges, and counter-party risks must first be dealt with. Leisinger explains that Alluvial provides a solution for enterprises by dealing with these hurdles that slow down adoption.

On regulations, Leisinger says that firms like Alluvial “really want” regulatory clarity. According to him, there are two types of staking: direct staking and actively managed staking. Both have different implications from a regulatory perspective around token ownership, security and transparency. Leisinger believes liquid staking is better positioned to withstand regulatory pressure due to its transparency.

What’s more, Leisinger admits that a lack of regulatory clarity has had a chilling effect on institutional staking. Nevertheless, the Alluvial exec is optimistic that new milestones like the Ethereum Shapella upgrade will derisk participation in staking and attract interest.

The United Kingdom’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has turned its attention to artificial intelligence (AI) after announcing an examination of the impact of the technology on consumers and the economy.

On May 4, the regulator said it would be looking at the development and deployment of foundation models — applications like OpenAI’s ChatGPT — against key principles. Those include safety, transparency, fairness and accountability, among others. 

Sarah Cardell, the chief executive of the CMA, commented that since AI tools “burst” into the public sphere, regulators have had their eye on it.

“It’s a technology developing at speed and has the potential to transform the way businesses compete as well as drive substantial economic growth.“

She continued by deeming it “crucial” that businesses and consumers in the U.K. have access to the potential benefits of AI technologies while being shielded from fake information. AI-generated fakes have already started populating the web, resulting in lawsuits. 

The initial review will examine the competitive market for AI foundation models and their usage. Regulators plan to monitor how they can expand and present opportunities, along with risks to competition and consumers.

The CMA says its goal is to help the technology develop in ways that “ensure open, competitive markets and effective consumer protection.“

Additionally, the review is intended to produce “guiding principles” for the protection of consumers and support healthy competition as the technologies develop. A report on the findings is scheduled to be published in September 2023.

This announcement follows the publication of a white paper on AI from the U.K. government in March 2023.

On April 25, the U.K. prime minister and technology secretary revealed funding of 100 million British pounds ($124.8 million) to support a task force to accelerate the country’s AI readiness.

According to a May 4 announcement from Coinbase chief legal officer Paul Grewal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit responded to the complaint against the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding the need for clear rules for trading digital assets. This marks a development in the legal battle for regulatory clarity.

According to Grewal, the court’s response to their complaint against the SEC was a text-only order. The court has instructed the SEC to respond to Coinbase’s writ of mandamus within ten days. A writ of mandamus is a court order addressed to an inferior government official, ordering them to fulfill their official duties properly.

Grewal stated that the court had granted Coinbase the right to file a reply to the SEC’s response within seven days of the filing. He also expressed appreciation for the court’s thorough examination of the case.

Coinbase — the largest U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange — filed a lawsuit in April requesting that the court compel the SEC to publicly disclose its stance on a petition submitted several months prior. In the petition, the exchange posed 50 specific questions about the regulatory treatment of certain digital assets. The questions were wide-ranging, covering topics such as how tokens are classified as securities and seeking clarification on various other matters.

Despite the lack of public response to the petition, the SEC has increased enforcement and issued warnings to crypto exchanges. The commission has even issued a Wells notice to Coinbase in the past. A Wells notice letter typically warns a company that the SEC may follow with an enforcement action.

Due to the ongoing regulatory issues faced by the company, U.S. investment bank Citigroup downgraded the shares of the crypto exchange from “buy” to “neutral” and has also lowered its price target. The bank has cited “too many unknowns” as the reason for this downgrade. According to Citi analyst Peter Christiansen, the downgrade will be Until the regulatory “rules of the road” are better established in the United States.

""The platform will also collaborate with other leading blockchain firms to incubate innovative projects by young entrepreneurs and host U30 (Under the age of 30) hackathons to identify the most promising ones.""

Blockchain4Youth will commence this month with a series of campus lectures on Web3 held in universities across Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand. Bitget Academy courses will also be available around the same time. The exchange says it is open to partnerships with educators for its novel initiative. Currently, Bitget has around 8 million users across more than 100 countries.

According to a recent Bitget survey involving more than 250,000 respondents, 46% of millennials across major economies such as the United States, China, Japan, Germany, Nigeria and Indonesia currently own cryptocurrencies compared to 25% of Gen X, 21% of Gen Z and 8% of baby boomers. Furthermore, 27% of millennials and 36% of Gen Z respondents said they considered cryptocurrency regulation an important factor when voting for political candidates. 

In a similar venture, Binance Charity pledged to provide more than 30,000 scholarships in 2023. At the time, over 82,000 applicants were interested in joining the next cohort, equating to an acceptance rate of about 37%. The organization says it has committed $23 million to 32 Web3 social projects since its inception in 2018.

In the announcement, The Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy (FMCDE) cited a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) predicting the widespread adoption of blockchain technology across various industries could potentially contribute $1.76 trillion to the global gross domestic product by 2030, representing 1.4% of the world’s GDP.

The FMCDE developed the national blockchain policy through stakeholder consultations in both the public and private sectors. The policy was developed on behalf of the federal government of Nigeria, in line with the seventh pillar of the national digital economy policy and strategy, which focuses on digital society and emerging technologies.

A draft of the blockchain adoption strategy, released in October 2020, stated that blockchain and decentralized ledger technology would “facilitate the development of the Nigerian digital economy.”

The policy aims to establish a blockchain-based economy that facilitates secure transactions, data sharing and value exchange among individuals, businesses and the government. The implementation of the policy is expected to have a favorable impact on the public and private sectors in Nigeria.

The National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) will be responsible for coordinating the policy initiatives under the supervision of the FMCDE. Additionally, a multisectoral steering committee has been established to oversee policy implementation.

The Federal Executive Council has instructed relevant regulatory bodies, such as NITDA, the Central Bank of Nigeria, the National Universities Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nigerian Communications Commission to create regulatory frameworks for the implementation of blockchain technology in different sectors of the economy.

The deployment of crvUSD on the Ethereum network is a significant step toward the public release of the algorithmic stablecoin. Notably, the stablecoin remains inaccessible to general users, pending integration with Curve’s front-end user interface on its official website.

Responding to a query in the official Curve Finance Telegram chat about when users could expect to see the stablecoin released to the public, an admin claimed it would be coming “soon.”

At the time of publication, Curve Finance is one of the largest DeFi protocols in the industry, with roughly $4.4 billion in total value locked (TVL), according to data from DeFiLlama.

Algorithmic stablecoins became the focal point of industry-wide criticism following the collapse of the Terra ecosystem in May 2022, when the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin lost its peg and the value of its sister token Terra — later renamed Terra Classic (LUNC) — plunged by more than 99%. UST’s value was maintained by a complex arbitrage mechanism that was eventually brought down by a group of sophisticated traders. 

Curve’s crvUSD differs from the now-defunct UST, utilizing a similar design similar to MakerDAO’s

 stablecoin. According to the crvUSD whitepaper, crvUSD will function as a “collateralized-debt-position” stablecoin, meaning that users must deposit collateral in order to take out a loan in crvUSD. The preferred asset for use as collateral has not yet been specified by Curve Finance.

Curve isn’t the only DeFi protocol with its sights set on bringing an algorithmic stablecoin to market. Competitor protocol Aave (AAVE) released a testnet version of its “native decentralized, collateral-backed stablecoin,” dubbed GHO, this past February.

Curve’s plan to release an algorithmic stablecoin was first announced by Curve Team member mrblocktw in a tweet on July 21, 2022.

Later the same day, Curve’s founder, Michael Egorov confirmed that the stablecoin would be overcollateralized at the ReDeFine Tomorrow Web3 summit.

Following the launch of the new stablecoin, the protocol’s native Curve DAO (CRV) token spiked approximately 7% according to data from TradingView. CRV is currently changings hands for $0.96.

The Texas State Securities Board joined several state regulators in issuing cease-and-desist orders against Horatiu Charlie Caragaceanu and his organizations, The Shark of Wall Street and Hedge4.ai, for promoting two cryptocurrencies named TruthGPT Coin and Elon Musk AI Token. The orders seek to clamp down on what they claim is a fraudulent securities scheme attempting to capitalize on the growing buzz around artificial intelligence (AI).

The TruthGPT Coin is being marketed as a cryptocurrency that utilizes an AI system called Elon Musk AI. The AI model can allegedly examine multiple digital assets, anticipate future cryptocurrency values and distinguish lucrative investments from fraudulent ones. The parties involved are also promoting TruthGPT Coin as a highly profitable venture, even stating it could increase in worth by a staggering 10,000 times.

The Emergency Cease and Desist Order states that investors are being falsely informed of Elon Musk's endorsement of TruthGPT Coin, and animated avatars and images of Musk are being utilized to give the impression of his support. Promotional media also shows the alleged involvement of other public figures, including Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the founder and CEO of Binance, and Vitalik Buterin, the co-founder of Ethereum. 

Securities Commissioner Travis Iles cautioned, ""Bad actors continue their attempts to capitalize on this widespread public interest."" He explained: 

""They’re devising schemes that create the appearance that they have developed sophisticated artificial intelligence platforms — but instead of being rooted in artificial intelligence, the offerings too often are nothing more than frauds.”

Texas State Securities Board Enforcement Director Joe Rotunda advised investors to stay vigilant and “to set aside emotion and objectively evaluate every offering — especially when pitched by an unknown person through the internet.”

Related: How is artificial intelligence used in fraud detection?

The fraudulent scheme highlights the continuous need for caution and due diligence in the cryptocurrency industry. Using buzzwords like ""artificial intelligence"" can be enticing for investors, but it can also be used by bad actors to promote fraudulent activities like pump-and-dump schemes, which is common within the crypto industry.

According to data gathered by Chainalysis, “Of the 40,521 tokens launched in 2022 that gained sufficient traction to be worth analyzing, 9,902, or 24%, saw a price decline in the first week indicative of possible pump and dump activity.”

"What are convolutional neural networks?","Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks widely used in computer vision applications such as image recognition.","1.
What are convolutional neural networks in deep learning?

Convolutional neural networks are used in computer vision tasks, which employ convolutional layers to extract features from input data.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a class of deep neural networks commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image and video recognition, object detection and image segmentation. 

Neural networks are machine learning models consisting of interconnected nodes that process information to make decisions, while deep neural networks have multiple hidden layers that enable them to learn complex representations for various tasks. They both mimic the structure and function of the human brain. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to interpret and understand visual data from the world.

Although image and video recognition involves classifying or recognizing objects, scenes or actions in photos or videos, object detection involves locating certain things inside an image or video. Image segmentation involves dividing an image into meaningful segments or regions for further analysis or manipulation.

CNNs use several convolutional layers to automatically extract features from input data. The input data is subjected to filters by the convolutional layers, with the feature maps produced passed into further processing layers. Convolutional layers are the building blocks of CNNs that perform the operation of filtering and feature extraction on input data.

Filtering is the process of convolving an image with a filter to extract features, while feature extraction is the process of identifying relevant patterns or features from the convolved images. 

Pooling layers, which downsample the output of the convolutional layers to lower the computational cost and increase the network’s capacity to generalize to new inputs, are frequently included in CNNs in addition to the convolutional layers. Additional typical layers include normalization layers, which help to lower overfitting and enhance the network’s performance, and fully connected layers, which are utilized for classification or prediction tasks.

Many applications, such as facial recognition, self-driving cars, medical image analysis and natural language processing (NLP), have extensively used CNNs. They have also been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in image classification tasks, such as the ImageNet challenge.

2.
How do convolutional neural networks work?

Convolutional neural networks work by extracting features from input data through convolutional layers and learning to classify the input data through fully connected layers.

The steps involved in the working of convolutional neural networks include the following:

Input layer: The input layer — the first layer in a CNN — takes raw data as input, like an image or a video, and sends it to the next layer for processing.
Convolutional layer: The feature extraction takes place in the convolutional layer. This layer applies a collection of filters or kernels to extract features like edges, corners and forms from the input data.
ReLU layer: To provide non-linearity to the output and enhance the performance of the network, a rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function is frequently implemented after each convolutional layer. ReLU outputs the input directly if it is positive and outputs zero if it is negative.
Pooling layer: The convolutional layer’s feature maps are formed with a pooling layer, which reduces their dimensionality. Max-pooling is a commonly used technique where the maximum value in each patch of the feature map is taken as the output.
Fully connected layer: The fully connected layer takes the flattened output of the pooling layer and applies a set of weights to produce the final output, which can be used for classification or prediction tasks.

Here is an illustration of how CNN would categorize pictures of cats and dogs:

Step 1: The input layer receives 3-channel (RGB) images of a dog or cat and other raw image data. A 3-channel (RGB) is a standard format used to represent color images in neural networks, with each pixel being represented by three values representing the intensity of the red, green and blue color channels.
Step 2: The convolutional layer applies a series of filters to the input image to extract features like edges, corners and forms.
Step 3: Convolutional layer output becomes non-linear due to the ReLU layer.
Step 4: By taking the maximum value in each feature map patch, the pooling layer lowers the dimensionality of the feature maps created by the convolutional layer.
Step 5: Many convolutional and pooling layers are stacked to extract progressively complicated characteristics from the input image.
Step 6: Flatten layer converts the previous layer’s output into a one-dimensional or 1D vector (a sequence of numbers arranged in a single row or column, each representing a feature or characteristic). Then, a fully connected layer receives the flattened output of the last pooling layer and applies a set of weights to produce the final output, identifying whether the image is of a cat or a dog. 

The CNN is trained using a set of labeled images, with the weights of the filters and fully connected layers adjusted during training to minimize the error between the predicted and actual labels. Once trained, the convolutional neural network can accurately classify new, unseen images of cats and dogs.

3.
What are the types of convolutional neural networks?

Several types of convolutional neural networks exist, including traditional CNNs, recurrent neural networks, fully convolutional networks and spatial transformer networks — among others.

Traditional CNNs

Traditional CNNs, also known as “vanilla” CNNs, consist of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. As mentioned, each convolutional layer in this network runs a series of convolutions with a collection of teachable filters to extract features from the input image.

The Lenet-5 architecture, one of the first effective CNNs for handwritten digit recognition, illustrates a conventional CNN. It has two sets of convolutional and pooling layers following two fully connected layers. CNNs’ efficiency in image identification was proved by the Lenet-5 architecture, which also made them more widely used in computer vision tasks.

Recurrent neural networks

Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that can process sequential data by keeping track of the context of prior inputs. Recurrent neural networks can handle inputs of varying lengths and produce outputs dependent on the previous inputs, unlike typical feedforward neural networks, which only process input data in a fixed order.

For instance, RNNs can be utilized in NLP activities like text generation or language translation. A recurrent neural network can be trained on pairs of sentences in two different languages to learn to translate between the two. 

The RNN processes sentences one at a time, producing an output sentence depending on the input sentence and the preceding output at each step. The RNN can produce correct translations even for complex texts since it keeps track of past inputs and outputs.

Fully convolutional networks

Fully convolutional networks (FCNs) are a type of neural network architecture commonly used in computer vision tasks such as image segmentation, object detection and image classification. FCNs can be trained end-to-end using backpropagation to categorize or segment images. 

Backpropagation is a training algorithm that computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights of a neural network. A machine learning model’s ability to predict the anticipated output for a given input is measured by a loss function.

FCNs are solely based on convolutional layers, as they do not have any fully connected layers, making them more adaptable and computationally efficient than conventional convolutional neural networks. A network that accepts an input image and outputs the location and classification of objects within the image is an example of an FCN.

Spatial transformer network

A spatial transformer network (STN) is used in computer vision tasks to improve the spatial invariance of the features learned by the network. The ability of a neural network to recognize patterns or objects in an image independent of their geographical location, orientation or scale is known as spatial invariance. 

A network that applies a learned spatial transformation to an input image before processing it further is an example of an STN. The transformation could be used to align objects within the image, correct for perspective distortion or perform other spatial changes to enhance the network’s performance on a specific job.

A transformation refers to any operation that modifies an image in some way, such as rotating, scaling or cropping. Alignment refers to the process of ensuring that objects within an image are centered, oriented or positioned in a consistent and meaningful way. 

When objects in an image appear skewed or deformed due to the angle or distance from which the image was taken, perspective distortion occurs. Applying several mathematical transformations to the image, such as affine transformations, can be used to correct for perspective distortion. Affine transformations preserve parallel lines and ratios of distances between points to correct for perspective distortion or other spatial changes in an image.

Spatial changes refer to any modifications to the spatial structure of an image, such as flipping, rotating or translating the image. These changes can augment the training data or address specific challenges in the task, such as lighting, contrast or background variations.

4.
What are the advantages of CNNs?

CNNs are preferred in computer vision tasks due to their advantages, including translation invariance, parameter sharing, hierarchical representations, resilience to changes and end-to-end training.

Convolutional neural networks have several advantages, making them an attractive choice for various computer vision tasks. One of their main advantages is translation invariance, a feature of CNNs that allows them to recognize objects in an image regardless of their position. Convolutional layers are used to accomplish this by applying filters to the full input image so that the network can learn features that are translation-invariant.

The use of parameter sharing, in which the same set of parameters is shared across all areas of the input image, is another benefit of CNNs. As a result, the network has fewer parameters and can better generalize new data, which is crucial when working with huge data sets.

CNNs can also learn hierarchical representations of the input image, with the upper layers learning more complicated features like object pieces and forms, while the lower layers learn simpler elements like edges and textures. For challenging tasks like object detection and segmentation, this hierarchical model enables the network to learn characteristics at many levels of abstraction.

CNNs are suitable for real-world applications because they are resilient to changes in lighting, color and tiny distortions in the input image. Finally, convolutional neural networks can be trained end-to-end, allowing gradient descent to simultaneously optimize all of the network’s parameters for performance and faster convergence. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm used to iteratively adjust model parameters by minimizing the loss function in the direction of the negative gradient. 

5.
What are the disadvantages of CNNs?

CNNs have drawbacks such as lengthy training time, the need for large labeled data sets and susceptibility to overfitting. Network complexity can also affect performance. However, CNNs remain a widely used and effective tool in computer vision, including object detection and segmentation, despite limitations in tasks requiring contextual knowledge like NLP.

Convolutional neural networks have several drawbacks that can make using them in some machine learning applications difficult. For instance, CNN training can take a while, especially for large data sets, because CNNs are computationally expensive. Furthermore, creating the CNN architecture can be challenging and necessitates a thorough comprehension of the fundamental ideas of artificial neural networks.

Another drawback is that CNNs need a lot of labeled data to train effectively. This can be a serious constraint in the circumstances with little data available. CNNs are also not always successful at tasks that require more contextual knowledge, such as NLP, even if they are quite good at image recognition tasks.

The number and kind of layers employed in CNN design can affect performance. For instance, adding more layers might improve accuracy but increase network complexity and computing costs at the same time. Deep learning CNN architectures are also vulnerable to overfitting, which happens when a network gets overly specialized to the training data and performs poorly on new, untrained data.

Despite these drawbacks, CNNs are still a widely used and very effective tool for deep learning and machine learning algorithms in the field of artificial neural networks, including segmentation, object detection and image recognition. That said, CNNs will remain a key player in computer vision.","https://cointelegraph.com/explained/what-are-convolutional-neural-networks"

The integration of Google Cloud Marketplace will provide high-integrity blockchain data from Flare nodes and connected chain nodes to a large pool of developers and users of the software products and services platform. This includes blockchain APIs for Algorand, BNB Smart Chain, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Flare, Litecoin, Songbird, XRP ledger and future-supported blockchain APIs.

Blockchain APIs are touted to free developers from having to run their own nodes for the respective blockchains they are interacting with. The data supplied powers applications that execute transactions and query the latest state of a blockchain by calling up on-chain data.

Flare highlights blockchain APIs as valuable for building cross-chain applications that query various data sources, including major cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets that use its API portal.

A statement from Flare’s vice president of engineering Josh Edwards highlighted that the provision of blockchain APIs to platforms like Google Cloud Marketplace will play a role in increased Web3 participation:

“It makes it easier for developers to experiment with blockchain technology and its many use cases without being burdened by onerous hardware costs and ongoing maintenance.”

Edwards also suggested that larger organizations and partners making use of Google Cloud Marketplace would potentially experiment with the secure and approved Web3 APIs.

The EVM-based layer 1 aims to extend the utility of blockchain technology by providing data from various chains and Web2 sources, which could climb to over 100 chains that form Flare’s oracle.

A new Cosmos-based blockchain called “Tenet'' will use liquid staking coins from other networks to secure its transactions, potentially allowing the new network to inherit the security of older ones, according to a May 3 announcement from the developers. 

The network is currently available as a testnet and will launch a mainnet version as soon as testing is complete. This comes after liquid staking has recently become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol category.

Liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Ankr allow users to stake their coins with a network of validators and receive rewards without having to run their own nodes. These protocols also provide users with tokens called “liquid staking derivatives,” or LSDs, redeemable for the underlying deposits and rewards.

According to the announcement, Tenet will allow users to “restake” these LSDs to earn additional rewards on its network. And it will provide users with tokens that represent the LSDs themselves. The team calls these third-order tokens “liquid liquid staking derivatives,” or LLSDs. LLSDs will be usable in lending apps and decentralized exchanges throughout the Tenet network, the announcement said.

The team expects there to be two core benefits to using LSDs instead of a native coin to secure the network. First, it “ensures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each [layer 1] ecosystem it services.” Second, it should “bring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs.”

The new network is being developed by former executives of Ankr and Blockdaemon and is advised by members of the Lido, Ankr and OpenAI teams.

Liquid staking protocols have existed since 2020 when Lido was first launched. They grew in popularity in 2022 and early 2023 as the Ethereum network implemented a move to proof-of-stake and began to allow staking withdrawals. On May 1, crypto analytics platform DefiLlama announced that liquid staking had become the top category of DeFi apps when measured by total value locked.

Some experts have argued that liquid staking may grow in the future as a result of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.

A new Cosmos-based blockchain called “Tenet'' will use liquid staking coins from other networks to secure its transactions, potentially allowing the new network to inherit the security of older ones, according to a May 3 announcement from the developers.

The network is currently available as a testnet and will launch a mainnet version as soon as testing is complete. This comes after liquid staking has recently become the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol category.

Liquid staking protocols such as Lido, Rocket Pool and Ankr allow users to stake their coins with a network of validators and receive rewards without having to run their own nodes. These protocols also provide users with tokens called “liquid staking derivatives,” or LSDs, redeemable for the underlying deposits and rewards.

According to the announcement, Tenet will allow users to “restake” these LSDs to earn additional rewards on its network. And it will provide users with tokens that represent the LSDs themselves. The team calls these third-order tokens “liquid liquid staking derivatives,” or LLSDs. LLSDs will be usable in lending apps and decentralized exchanges throughout the Tenet network, the announcement said.

The team expects there to be two core benefits to using LSDs instead of a native coin to secure the network. First, it “ensures the long-term security of the Tenet chain by leveraging the joint security of each [layer 1] ecosystem it services.” Second, it should “bring additional liquidity and yield opportunities to LSDs.”

 to be restaked on Tenet.

The new network is being developed by former executives of Ankr and Blockdaemon and is advised by members of the Lido, Ankr and OpenAI teams.

Liquid staking protocols have existed since 2020 when Lido was first launched. They grew in popularity in 2022 and early 2023 as the Ethereum network implemented a move to proof-of-stake and began to allow staking withdrawals. On May 1, crypto analytics platform DefiLlama announced that liquid staking had become the top category of DeFi apps when measured by total value locked.

Some experts have argued that liquid staking may grow in the future as a result of the Ethereum Shanghai upgrade.

According to an official announcement by the Sui Foundation, the Sui mainnet went live at 12:00 pm UTC. Many global crypto trading platforms supported the Sui mainnet launch, enabling investors to buy and sell the new SUI token.

Crypto exchange Binance plans to debut SUI trading immediately after mainnet launch. The platform will allow users to trade between SUI and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

, Tether 

USDT

$1.00

 and BNB 

BNB

$313

 at 12:15 pm UTC. The firm will also enable investors to exchange SUI against euros and Turkish liras.

Other big exchanges, including Huobi, KuCoin, ByBit, OKX and Poloniex, also announced SUI listings. KuCoin noted that it also plans to list SUI/USDT-margined futures and isolated margin trading pair SUI/USDT when its “liquidity meets the requirement.”

Poloniex also emphasized that the total supply of SUI is capped at 10 billion tokens.

Some South Korean exchanges, known to face investigations by local authorities for listing certain native coins, have joined the global SUI hype. Upbit is one of those exchanges preparing to start SUI trading on May 3.

Shortly after the trading launch, the value of the SUI took a sharp dive to below $2. According to data from CoingGecko, SUI tanked 40% from its opening price. In the meantime, data from CoinMarketCap and Binance suggest that SUI even dropped more than 70%. The SUI token lost the majority of value in the first five minutes after the launch of trading.

At the time of writing, the token is trading at $1.29. SUI’s fully diluted market capitalization amounts to about $13 billion.

Even the current price of SUI is significantly higher than the price of the token during its spotlight token sale in April. During a token sale in mid-April, users of exchanges like KuCoin and OKX were able to buy SUI tokens at 0.1 USDT per coin.

Binance users deposited massive amounts of cryptocurrency to farm SUI tokens before the mainnet launch. According to data from Binance Launchpad, users of Binance staked nearly $4 billion in Binance Coin 

BNB

$313

 and TrueUSD (TUSD) to farm 40 million SUI tokens. At the time of writing, the combined value of all these tokens amounts to $51 million.

What is SUI token?

Sui, or the Sui Network, is a layer-1 blockchain and smart contract platform designed to increase Web3 adoption with fast speeds and high scalability.

Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchains — which run on proof-of-work and proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms, respectively — the Sui platform relies on delegated proof-of-stake. That means that SUI network users can elect and vote for delegates to confirm the next block.

The Sui project is famous for being built on Move, a new Rust-based programming language designed at Meta, formerly known as Facebook. Sui is backed by Mysten Labs, a Web3 infrastructure organization founded by former senior executives at Meta’s Novi Research.

After Meta shut down its crypto project Diem in 2022, Mysten Labs started actively working on the Sui network. In September 2022, the Sui Foundation announced a $300 million raise for the development of the Sui ecosystem.

Bitcoin’s BRC-20 token standard has become the latest trend in the crypto ecosystem, especially after the Pepe (PEPE) memecoin rise in recent months. A total of 8,500 different tokens have been minted using the BRC-20 standard, with the majority of these BRC-20 tokens being memecoins, such as PEPE and Memetic (MEME).

BRC-20 is an experimental token standard on the Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

 blockchain modeled on Ethereum’s ERC-20. It allows programmers to create and send fungible tokens via the Ordinals protocol.

Although modeled after ERC-20, the BRC-20 token standard fundamentally differs from its Ethereum-based counterpart. BRC-20 tokens don’t make use of smart contracts. The token standard also requires a Bitcoin wallet to mint and trade these tokens.

The BRC-20 token standard was created early in March by an anonymous on-chain analyst called Domo. The objective was to make it possible for fungible tokens to be issued and transferred on the Bitcoin blockchain. The market cap of BRC-20 tokens has exploded over the past month and currently sits at $120 million, a 600% rise in the past week.

The BRC-20 token frenzy has also dwarfed the blockchain’s original number of Bitcoin transactions. The number of BRC-20 transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between April 29 and May 2 reached over 50%, outperforming regular BTC transactions.

The BRC-20 token volume peaked on May 1 at 366,000 transactions, with the total number of transactions on the network being 2.36 million.

Along with the rise in BRC-20 transactions, transaction fees have surged due to the new token activity. Since its inception in late April, the network has generated an additional 109.7 BTC in transaction fees for miners.

The memecoin frenzy has been a notable topic on the Ethereum blockchain, but with the rise of the BRC-20 standard, a similar trend is also observed on the Bitcoin blockchain. The memecoin craze has also led to a significant rise in Ethereum network gas fees, contributing to network congestion.

Being stuck at home for almost two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people around the world are eager to experience new cities, countries and cultures. The flexibility of working from home now allows travelers to plan around a less home-bound lifestyle. However, age-old problems, including delayed or canceled transportation, lost luggage and check-in mixups, continue to trouble the travel industry, which is expected to tap $850 billion in revenue by the end of 2023.

People rightly have high expectations for their travel experience, including low cost, better security, transparency and personalisation. These demands can be met with the help of peer-to-peer (P2P) connections, decentralized networks, fast transactions and interoperable systems that enable seamless data exchange.

That's why the travel industry needs blockchain solutions. The transparent, scalable and secure nature of blockchain technology can reduce costs, increase efficiency and foster collaboration to provide a more streamlined and personalised experience for travellers.

However, current blockchain networks fail to meet the needs of the highly-specialized nature of the travel industry, which works with fragmented processes across multiple stakeholders and where trust and regulatory compliance are crucial. A uniquely-designed blockchain is needed today to act as a layer 1 infrastructure to address the specific requirements of the travel industry.

Industry pioneers joined forces for efficiency

Seeing how blockchain can improve the current travel experience for all parties, industry pioneers, stakeholders and Web3 professionals come together to launch an inclusive blockchain ecosystem named Camino Network to pave the way for innovation in the multi-billion dollar industry. Supported by the travel giants like TUI, Lufthansa, Miles & More and Eurowings, Camino Network lays the groundwork for an entire ecosystem of Web3 travel apps and services.

Built on Avalanche’s technical base, Camino’s blockchain is tailored specifically for the travel ecosystem. The project leverages the next-generation capabilities of this technology to bring efficiency, security and innovation to the travel industry with the aim to provide better, more personalized experiences for travelers around the world.

Cutting down transaction costs by using blockchain helps with reducing fees for both businesses and users. A number of key players from the travel industry announced their backing for the Camino Network, with over 80 of them directly supporting the infrastructure by acting as initial validators of the blockchain.

NFTs and digital wallets for personalized travel experience

Despite being an essential need for travelers, updating hotel and accommodation info needs constant effort with legacy infrastructures. The information flow is bound by multiple bilateral contracts and interfaces, commonly resulting in outdated info for guests. Camino uses blockchain for more streamlined data management across all parties with nonfungible tokens (NFTs).

While NFTs are mainly known as digital collectibles in the Web3 space, the travel industry presents immense potential to go beyond one use case and introduce actual utility. Similarly, the travel industry can benefit from the flexibility and reliability of NFTs for many legs or a travel experience, making it an ideal match. With NFTs, it becomes possible to produce hotel or other key travel info as a unique digital token, where the info is stored in a decentralized manner. The crucial info NFT contains can be automatically updated whenever new information becomes available, keeping the latest version of data for all parties involved. With better management tools and systems developed for the Web3 era, the Camino Network enables all stakeholders in the industry to benefit from a secure and transparent ecosystem.

NFTs can also help with the tokenization of assets of inventory, potentially bringing a new marketplace where everything about the travel experience can be sold and exchanged for a much wider range of personalization. An NFT can act as digital ownership proof for travel-related assets, from flight tickets to hotel rooms and loyalty points, introducing a new level of reliability to the industry by solving fraud and payment risks. It also takes the stress out of last-minute decisions, a common headache for both customers and airlines, by making it easy to resell any tickets for both customers and airlines. Camino Network can serve as the basis for an NFT-based voucher platform to remove manual and lengthy processes from redeeming travel coupons with smart contracts. With a broad range of use cases, NFTs will provide new revenue streams and pave the way for new business models within the travel industry.

The next chapter of travel is taking off

To provide a safe and secure environment for Web3 developers, over 200,000 lines of code written for the Camino blockchain were audited by prominent cybersecurity service provider Hexens. The team also launched a hacker bounty hunt for the Camino Network to prove its reliability.

Web3 developers and travel companies who aim to transform the industry have already started working on the Camino Network for a wide range of decentralized apps. The Camino Network invites everyone — both from the travel industry and the Web3 space — to join hands to prepare an age-old industry for the next generation of travelers.

Combining ordinals with ZK technology: The future of ‘smart’ Bitcoin?

Using ordinals and zero-knowledge technology can make Bitcoin transactions simpler, but also form an important step toward a ‘smart’ Bitcoin.

The rise of ordinals on Bitcoin 

BTC

$27,775

 has opened many doors for developers and users. By permanently inscribing data on the Bitcoin blockchain, digital objects like art can have verifiable ownership. However, not only digital art objects can benefit from this development. Domain addresses are also possible using this technology.

Untangling public wallet keys

Sending and receiving transactions over the blockchain has many advantages. Some of these include the verifiability of transactions and the immutability of the blockchain. Thanks to the blockchain, digital value can be transacted in perpetuity, like a person handing over a physical dollar bill to someone else.

However, using the technology is not so simple for everyone. Users need a certain amount of knowledge about how blockchain and their wallets work, and they also need to know how to securely send crypto to a wallet.

One of the difficulties users might experience is that public keys can be quite intimidating. They are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters. One mistake and the crypto is either lost or ends up in the wrong wallet. And with the immutability of the blockchain, there is no way to get it back.

Where there is a need, developers get to work. One of the popular projects that aim to make crypto transactions more user-friendly is Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This platform turns these complicated wallet addresses on Ethereum into easily readable domain names, just like any website.

For a long time, however, it was impossible to integrate a comparable solution for the Bitcoin network.

A step toward ‘smart’ Bitcoin

This all changes with BTCDomain. The platform uses ordinals and zk-STARKs, short for “zero-knowledge Succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge,” to generate unique domain addresses that can be used on the Bitcoin network. But how does it work under the hood?

In essence, ordinals are unique inscriptions in transactions on the Bitcoin network. In this way, ordinals are verifiable using a blockchain explorer. BTCDomain uses this approach to associate Bitcoin domain addresses. The platform contains all the necessary metadata within a Bitcoin transaction. When a user sends BTC to one of the registered domains, for example, “satoshi.btc,” the platform resolves the underlying public key so that the BTC ends up at the correct address.

To ensure that this happens correctly, users should be able to trust that the system is resolving the transaction correctly. This is where the zk-STARK technology comes in.

One of the options is for users to run a full Bitcoin node in combination with an ordinal database on their own machine. While this is possible, it requires some technical skills and time. BTCDomain solves this problem by resolving a transaction using the resources of the platform. It inspects each Bitcoin transaction and generates a zero-knowledge proof. Users can then confirm that the domain address holds the underlying public key they are sending BTC to.

What’s more, with the latest Miami update, BTCDomain now allows users to inscribe their own website on the Bitcoin network. Thanks to the update the platform can automatically resolve domain names to the dedicated web2 website. For example, if a user owns ordinal.btc and builds an html file and inscribes it on the Bitcoin network, BTCdomain can automatically show this website on ordinal.btc.page.

Criticism against ordinals

However, the use of ordinals on Bitcoin has drawn criticism. Due to its growing popularity, the network’s activity increased significantly. In turn, this led to higher transaction fees, leading critics to oppose the use of the Bitcoin network for anything other than financial transactions. Founder of BTCDomain Jay Lee is a firm believer that it is everyone’s own choice what they do with Bitcoin: “Everyone could always use Bitcoin as a financial transaction chain. We (who believe in ‘smart’ Bitcoin) don’t affect any original use of Bitcoin. Someone might argue ordinals have pushed transaction fees higher. But we are in a free market. Whoever pays the highest gas fee rate gets included in a block. It is fair.”

According to Lee, BTCDomain brings “smart Bitcoin” closer by showing developers that it is possible to build trustless applications that rely only on Bitcoin. This could lead to a thriving decentralized finance sector built on the Bitcoin blockchain in the future.

According to a May 1 press release, the FBI’s Detroit Field Office and the National Police of Ukraine “conducted coordinated, court-authorized activity” that resulted in the shutdown and seizure of the domains of nine virtual currency exchange services.

The seized domains included the websites 24xbtc.com, 100btc.pro, pridechange.com, trust-exchange.org and bitcoin24.exchange. Each reportedly offered entirely anonymous digital currency exchange services to their users, skirting many of the rules and regulations required of licensed crypto exchanges.

Anyone attempting to access these websites will see a seizure notice from the authorities.

The FBI noted the exchanges, which offered services in both English and Russian, featured “lax” Anti-Money Laundering measures and collected minimal Know Your Customer information or “none at all.”

The FBI claimed these kinds of rogue, unlicenced exchanges “serve as important hubs in the cybercrime ecosystem.”

According to the agency, many of these virtual currency exchanges were “advertised on online forums dedicated to discussing criminal activity.”

“Much of the criminal activity occurring at the affected exchanges involved cyber actors responsible for ransomware, but also other scammers, and cybercriminals.”

The FBI has been involved in a number of cryptocurrency-related issues over the past few months.

A myriad of unforeseeable “consequences” could be brought about by retail central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), the managing director of the International Monetary Fund has claimed.

The IMF's Kristalina Georgieva erred on the side of caution regarding retail CBDCs in a May 1 interview at the Milken Institute’s 2023 Global Conference.

Georgieva explained the IMF considers retail CBDCs to have far more room for error than wholesale CBDCs.

“We think that wholesale CBDCs can be put in place with fairly little space for undesirable surprises, whereas retail CBDCs completely transform the financial system in a way that we don’t quite know what consequences it could bring.”

Retail CBDCs are state-backed virtual currencies issued by central banks for use by consumers and businesses.

Wholesale CBDCs are similarly central bank-issued but are designed to allow financial institutions to carry reserve deposits with a central bank.

The IMF is collaborating with about 50 countries to ensure best practices are adopted, Georgieva said, which she expects to have a huge influence on the banks and economies in the future.

“We are engaging with countries, we work with some 50 countries now on this very topic,” the IMF executive said.

“We will see a very significant transformation that comes from CBDCs.”

Georgieva noted that “even” the United States is engaging in CBDC development now, which led her to conclude that “the future” of CBDCs is now here:

“Even in the U.S. where that was for quite some time a topic of not great interest, now there is engagement, and for the right reason. The future has arrived.”

The IMF announced on April 12 that it will publish a CBDC handbook to help central banks with CBDC design and implementation. The financial agency of the United Nations said the decision came following “unprecedented” levels of interest from nations around the world.

Through Super Ticket, attendees can scan their NFTs for expedited entry passes, drink coupons and music downloads before the event and can receive post-event video content and rewards thereafter. ""Guests will keep their tickets to your event in their digital wallet forever,"" the new website tells event organizers.

Launched in June 2021, SI Tickets has grown to over $2.5 billion in marketplace inventory. The platform claims to charge zero transaction fees on any purchase and guarantees a 100% refund if an event is canceled for any reason. Box Office said it would charge $1.40 and 3% commission per ticket plus 3% merchant pass-through fees for event organizers.

“How do we onboard the next billion users into crypto?” This is a question that gets thrown around at crypto conferences and metaverse meetups — one that people have been asking for some time. Reaching mass adoption may sound like a daunting task, but crypto media outlets like Cointelegraph help spread the news of what is going on in the cryptoverse every day, helping increase adoption.

Many people in the crypto space have likely had experiences where others ask them questions about various aspects of cryptocurrency, and trying to cohesively explain all the intricacies in one sitting can be a challenge. This tricky situation is what inspired the latest report from Cointelegraph Research.

Download the report on the Cointelegraph Research Terminal.

The “ABCs of Crypto” report is a perfect start for those new to blockchain, giving a high-level overview of the major cryptocurrencies and blockchains, decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs). Throughout the report are links and references to all the useful resources found on Cointelegraph’s website. By combining these with other on-chain and statistical data from various sources, “ABCs of Crypto” is meant to be a starting place for those new to the space to learn about everything from why they should care about DeFi to the difference between hot and cold wallets and how NFT marketplaces work.

The world has just begun to adopt blockchain technology

Believe it or not, it took around five decades for electricity to be adopted by nearly 100% of households in the United States. It took the radio around four decades, color televisions took about three, and the internet took almost two decades. The adoption curve of modern technology seems to be getting shorter and shorter. The blockchain industry can be said to have started seeing adoption in the last five to six years. If Metcalfe’s law of exponential network effects spurred on by more users and usage holds true, blockchain may experience an even shorter adoption curve than other technologies of the past century.

DeFi and NFTs are good starting points

Finance and art are two aspects of the human experience that fit perfectly with blockchain, decentralized ledgers and all things crypto. The “ABCs of Crypto” report first focuses on understanding Bitcoin

, then moves on to other major platforms like Ethereum before discussing decentralized exchanges. It continues on to give readers an introduction to the world of DeFi. Starting with a timeline of NFTs, the report also explores how nonfungible tokens can be used outside of digital art in the form of JPGs — including music, tickets, land and identity.

Cointelegraph Research’s latest report is a starting place to help bring new people into the world of crypto. What better way to become part of the change and put Metcalfe’s law into full effect than by helping at least one or two people hop on board and get comfortable with all that the future of money has to offer?

According to data sourced from user @beetle from Dune Dashboard, nonfungible token (NFT) marketplace Blur has facilitated 8,820 Ether, or roughly $16.37 million, in loans through perpetual NFT lending protocol Blend one day after its launch. On May 1, Blur introduced Blend as a novel protocol for pledging NFTs for loans, which was developed in conjunction with venture capital firm Paradigm.

Together, the Azuki, Wrapped CryptoPunks and Milady NFT collections represent the largest collateral, with over 8,000 Ether

 worth in market value pledged. The top Blur lender, who has issued 58 loans worth 1,180 ETH, is Taiwanese celebrity Jeff Huang, also known as Machi Big Brother.

A prominent figure in Taiwan's music industry, Machi Big Brother is also an avid collector of the Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT series. Machi was one of the biggest recipients of the Blur token airdrop in February and reportedly sold 1,010 NFTs within 48 hours on Feb. 25 in the ""largest NFT dump ever.""

There are 846 active loans on the platform at the time of publication, with eight refinancing events. As a perpetual lending protocol, Blend automatically extends the duration of loans at expiry, assuming neither the borrowing nor lending party objects. Loans can also be refinanced or held at Dutch auction in case of interest rate changes. Protocol developers claim that Blend charges neither borrowing nor lending fees, but only interest.

Last year, NFT lending protocols fell into disarray after a crypto bear market caused many collectibles to become illiquid, some of which had no bids at all. One protocol, BendDAO, had as little as $23,715 to pay back lenders at the time after facilitating more than 15,000 ETH in loans.

Udemy’s ""Global Workplace Learning Index"" for the first quarter of 2023 indicates that ChatGPT, financial services and courses aimed at developing students' business-teaching skills have experienced a massive uptick in interest from the site’s reported 49 million users.

This likely comes as no surprise, as the public is currently experiencing what Wired recently described as a “Wet Hot AI Chatbot Summer” coming on the heels of OpenAI’s launch of ChatGPT.

According to Udemy, topic consumption — the number of users taking courses featuring skills specific to one subject — has risen 4,419% for ChatGPT.

Other top tech skills receiving increased interest from students included Nutanix, Azure Machine Learning and Amazon Elastic MapReduce — all cloud-related courses with applications in the field of machine learning. Artificial intelligence (AI) art generation also showed an uptick in interest, as did illustration.

The report also summarizes the top three surging skills by popularity for 15 countries. Despite the increase in topic consumption, ChatGPT only managed to break into the top three for the U.S. market, where it sits at the top spot. AI topped the list in Argentina and came in second in Canada.

Also of note, manufacturing, government and financial services topped the list of surging industries, with related skills seeing outsized growth.

Beyond the tech industry, the report provides figures for skills in the “professional power skills” category. Leading the list is “teaching.” With a 764% increase in topic attention in Q1 2023, related skills were second only to ChatGPT in consumption. 

While the report doesn’t state any direct conclusions, it does include a quote from instructor Diego Davila, who said:

""Having a comprehensive understanding of ChatGPT and other emerging AI technologies will be imperative to quickly pivot in today’s era of rapid digital transformation.”

Chatbot technologies are already impacting the cryptocurrency world, with the advent of advanced trading bots capable of interfacing with third-party plugins built on ChatGPT and similar platforms becoming increasingly popular.

But the Udemy report also indicates that technologies underpinning blockchain development are seeing a rise in interest as well. Python certifications saw an uptick of 272% and FastAPI skills consumption increased by 102% — both are widely used in the development of blockchain tech.

Cybercriminals from the darkest parts of the internet are reportedly selling hacked, verified crypto accounts on the darknet for as low as just $30 apiece.

According to an April 24 research paper by online data security provider Privacy Affairs titled “The Dark Web Price Index,"" cybercriminals have been selling all manner of fraudulently obtained financial account information on the dark web.

The prices of some of the ill-gotten verified cryptocurrency accounts include:

Kraken: $1,170
Binance: $410
Crypto.com: $300
Coinbase: $250
U.S.-verified Bittrex account: $30

These figures mark a significant increase from the prices paid for the same account details in 2022, according to data from last year’s edition of the Dark Web Price Index. In 2022, hackers were paying just $260 and $250 for verified Kraken and Binance accounts, respectively.

Hacked accounts can be used to illegally evade Know Your Customer measures on popular cryptocurrency exchanges.

Cryptocurrency accounts aren’t the only items on the list. Account information for credit cards with balances of up to $5,000 are sold for just $110, while login credentials for online bank accounts with balances of up to $2,000 are sold for $60.

Login details for all manner of social media accounts are also up for grabs, including hacked Facebook, Airbnb and Gmail accounts, starting as low as $25 a pop.

In a statement concerning these shocking new figures, Privacy Affairs security researcher Miklos Zoltan said that internet users must be more cautious with their personal information than ever before.

“If someone gets their hands on your financial details or social media credentials, the prices mentioned above are basically what it’s worth to them,” Zoltan explained.

“There’s a good chance that you value these things much more than they do, as to them, you’re just another mark for a quick buck.”

The hacking of accounts at popular crypto exchanges has been a growing problem in the industry.

Recently, a customer of U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase filed a lawsuit against the company following an attack on his account.

He claimed to have lost “90% of his life savings” after he fell victim to a nefarious hack known as a “SIM swap” — where scammers gain control of a phone number by tricking the telecommunications provider into linking the number to their own SIM card.

Decentralized exchange Level Finance has experienced a security breach allowing an attacker to steal more than $1 million of the exchange’s native Level Finance (LVL) token.

Level Finance informed its 20,000 Twitter followers that more than 214,000 of the exchange’s LVL tokens had been drained and swapped into 3,345 Binance Coin 

BNB

$313

, with an approximate value of $1.01 million. 

According to blockchain security firm Peckshield, Level Finance’s “LevelReferralControllerV2” smart contract contained a bug that allowed for “repeated referral claims” from the same epoch. This was confirmed by Level Finance in a later statement made on Discord.

Meanwhile, according to data from Binance chain explorer BSC Scan, the v2 controller contract shows multiple calls of the “claim multiple” function over the past 48 hours.

At the time of writing, the implementation of the contract does not appear to have been altered since the advent of the attack; however, Level Finance said that it would deploy a new implementation of the referral contract within the next 12 hours.

The exchange also noted that its liquidity pools and related DAOs remain unaffected by the attack.

According to DeDotFiSecurity on Twitter, the team says that it has “temporarily shut down the referral program,” which has stopped the exploit.

On Discord, Level Finance said that the exploit had been isolated from other exploits and that users of the exchange should “stand by for a full post mortem.”

Liquid staking solutions such as Lido and Rocket Pool now have more total value locked (TVL) than decentralized exchanges (DEXs), making them the top category of DeFi protocols, according to data from crypto analytics platform DefiLlama.

TVL is a metric that measures the dollar value of all cryptocurrencies locked within a protocol’s smart contracts.

Liquid staking protocols have just recently taken the top spot. On April 13, there was only $17.19 billion of crypto locked in liquid staking contracts, compared to $18.89 billion in DEXs, according to archived information. However, DEXs have experienced a $1.66 billion decline to $17.2 billion, while liquid staking solutions have experienced a $280 million increase to $17.47 billion, giving them the top spot.

Liquid staking protocols are staking pools that stake crypto on behalf of users. These protocols also issue tokens to users that represent the person's deposited crypto. Because these tokens can be used in DeFi apps, liquid staking protocols allow users to both simultaneously stake their coins and use them in other applications.

According to DefiLlama’s May 1 data, Lido (stETH) is still the top staking protocol with $11.54 billion of cryptocurrency locked inside its contracts. Coinbase Wrapped Staked Ether (CBETH) is a distant second with $2.19 billion locked, and Rocket Pool (rETH) is third with $1.46 billion. The remaining protocols have less than $1 billion of TVL each but add up to $2.22 billion collectively.

Lido was the first liquid staking protocol, and it launched in 2020. Liquid staking has become more popular as Ethereum moved to proof-of-stake and allowed withdrawals.

On May 1, nonfungible tokens (NFTs) marketplace Blur launched Blend, a peer-to-peer perpetual lending protocol that supports NFT collateral. Developed with venture capital firm Paradigm, developers cite Blend's rationale as a means of ""financialization to scale.""

Advertisement

Blend has neither oracle dependencies nor expiries, allowing borrowing positions to open indefinitely until terminated. Developers also claim that the protocol would collect zero fees from borrowers and lenders:

""Blend matches users who want to borrow against their nonfungible collateral with whatever lender is willing to offer the most competitive rate, using a sophisticated off-chain offer protocol.""

Per design, Blend automatically ""rolls a borrowing position for as long as some lender is willing to lend that amount against the collateral."" For this, no on-chain transactions are required unless one party decides to exit the position or there is a change in interest rate.

By using a perpetual lending protocol, borrowers and lenders extend the loan expiration time by a predetermined period by default. If a lender wishes to terminate the loan against the borrower's wishes, an interest-rate ""Dutch auction"" for refinancing is held when the borrower has not repaid the debt at expiration. The auction begins at 0% refinance interest with a steadily rising rate.

""In Blend, an NFT may be liquidated whenever a lender triggers a refinancing auction and nobody is willing to take over the debt at any interest rate.""

That said, developers explained that borrowers can repay the loan at any time on Blend. ""If a borrower wants to change the amount they have borrowed or get a better interest rate, they can atomically take out a new loan against the collateral and use the new principal to repay the old loan,"" they wrote.

Launched in the third quarter of 2022, Blur has rewarded users with ""care packages,"" redeemable for BLUR tokens since Feb. 14 to increase trading activity. The platform has since surpassed OpenSea in terms of trading volume.

Social media is the digital world’s go-to source for entertainment, communication and self-expression. Despite developing new ways to monetize content, this monopolized market still lacks a transparent and engaging reward system for user-generated content. On top of that, there is no trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions.

For example, TikTok, a popular application that lets users create video shorts, implemented monetization features like Creator Fund and virtual gifts. However, the platform’s reward system still lacks transparency and fairness. Creators often express concern over the uneven distribution of revenue and the opaqueness of the algorithms that determine content reach and visibility.

Using the built-in paid advertising tag seems to lead to lower content views. Some successful TikTok influencers even observed their views drop after joining the fund, suspecting that the application was intentionally limiting their visibility to cap their payout. One of the influencers told Wired: “I ended up leaving the Creator Fund. I’d much rather my followers see my videos than make a few cents on views. I’m disappointed with the way it hurt people more than helped.”

Besides the lack of transparency, another issue plaguing most social media platforms is the lack of a reliable and trustworthy voting mechanism for crowdsourcing decisions. While users can gather opinions through comments, likes or informal polls, these methods are susceptible to manipulation and lack the security and verifiability required for transparent decision-making.

Privacy is king

To address the chronic lack of transparency and trustworthiness, Dutch social media platform SocialBlox is leveraging blockchain technology, with its main features revolving around decentralization, transparency and security. The all-in-one platform lets users unleash their creativity by sharing photos and videos to engage with communities.

The social media ecosystem is fueled by SBLX, SocialBlox’s native token that users can earn as a reward for using its platform and convert on secondary markets like decentralized exchanges.

To begin with, SocialBlox addresses the paramount issue of privacy by not sharing user data with third parties or using it to optimize the content algorithm. Social media giants, including Facebook and TikTok, have been accused of privacy-related wrongdoings, such as personal data leaks and misuse. SocialBlox has no revenue model for selling data. It doesn’t disclose nor sell user data to third parties.

Another feature highlighting the user-oriented approach is privacy-mode access. By default, the SocialBlox app does not show ads. Users can allow companies to show ads and collect SBLX tokens as a reward.

This app paves the way for post-to-earn platforms

Earning rewards from displaying ads is a good incentive, but the platform’s most interesting implementation is its post-to-earn initiative for users who complete challenges on the platform. With this feature, users can earn SBLX tokens by accepting challenges set by other individuals or groups. For example, users can track challenges and receive updates with a single click. They can engage followers in decisions like holiday destinations, car colors or meal choices, with the majority determining the outcome. Thanks to the transparent voting system backed by the verifiable nature of the Polygon blockchain, the application eliminates concerns of fake voting rounds. This transparent voting system also presents a significant opportunity for companies to attract participants in their voting rounds.

DOWNLOAD SOCIALBLOX FOR APPLE OR ANDROID

In the future, companies could challenge users to share a video of their newly purchased products in exchange for SBLX, or influencers could complete personalized challenges sent by their fans. And the SocialBlox app will allow creators to live a more decentralized life by providing the tools and platform to connect and share content with millions of people.

While nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been gaining traction since the start of the year, the hype element is now fading away. More digital artists and creators worldwide are using NFTs to monetize their work with minimal investment, transforming the digital art space. Nevertheless, the blurred lines between artistic expression, plagiarism and trademark infringement have caused legal challenges, as regulations around cryptocurrencies and digital collectibles aren’t cast in stone yet.

For example, the Hermes vs. Rothschild lawsuit addressed critical questions about trademark infringement and NFTs. In this case, the popular French luxury design house Hermes sued 28-year-old creator Mason Rothschild over his MetaBirkins collection, which included 100 NFTs featuring digital, fur-covered bags resembling Hermes’ iconic Birkin range. On Feb. 8, 2023, a nine-member jury reached a verdict in Hermes’ favor. The court found Rothschild liable for trademark infringement, trademark dilution and “cybersquatting,” awarding the company $133,000 in damages.

This legal battle underscored the importance of digital artists and big brands drawing clear lines between their work and trademarks to prevent a negative impact on both parties — at least until regulations are clarified. For users, explicit rules are of great importance, as they can prevent them from investing in scams and forgeries.

NFT analytics firm detects another case of IP infringement

In a potentially similar instance of IP infringement, NFT analytics firm bitsCrunch discovered that the popular NFT collection Coodles appears to incorporate the McDonald’s logo within an attribute labeled “McCoodles.” This particular attribute showcases the McDonald’s logo on hoodies in the collection. Out of 8,884 NFTs in the series, 434 of them feature the McDonald’s logo as an attribute.

At the time of writing, these 434 NFTs have generated over $500,000 in total volume, and 398 different owners have these McDonald’s-themed NFTs. The collection has garnered 3,373 Ether 

ETH

$1,855

 in overall volume, with a floor price of 0.0059 ETH since its inception.

According to OpenSea’s description of the project, Coodles is a “community rewarding collectibles project of 8,888 randomly generated NFTs on Ethereum.”

In the recent Hermes vs. Rothschild case, the court stated that artists, critics and commentators’ rights do not extend to the point where they cause confusion among consumers regarding the origin of the content. So far, there is no public information about any collaboration or agreement between McDonald’s and Coodles.

As per Kantar, McDonald’s is the sixth most valuable global brand and the fifth one in the United States. The brand’s value surged 27% in 2022 to almost $200 billion.

The case is relevant to McDonald’s, as the company has been actively expanding into the Metaverse, filing multiple trademark applications to establish virtual restaurants last year.

As established by the Hermes IP infringement case, featuring a brand’s logo in an unrelated NFT collection could potentially mislead consumers and damage the brand’s reputation. Moreover, NFT purchasers receive limited rights, increasing the risk of unintentional copyright infringement.

Anyone can detect IP infringement in NFTs

In the Hermes vs. Rothschild case, NFT marketplaces OpenSea, Rarible and Zora agreed to delist the MetaBirkins collection. This means that the owners of these NFTs have limited exposure to secondary markets to sell their assets. To avoid similar situations, investors should monitor NFTs and check for any IP infringement before making a purchase.

BitsCrunch has been developing APIs that assist brands in determining if their logos have been utilized in NFT collections, thus helping them safeguard their intellectual property rights. Thanks to its NFT Forgery Detection API, the blockchain analytics firm identified the connection between the Coodles collection and the McDonald’s logo.

Besides brands, this API allows anyone to track whether an NFT collection incorporates a brand name and, as a result, could be liable for IP infringement.

The AI-driven API can detect partially or completely counterfeit NFTs, fabricated logos and brand identities of well-known brands, as well as new or existing NFTs, to protect users from investing in potential scams and forgeries.

Guardians of the NFT ecosystem

In the blockchain space, NFTs have had the most widespread adoption in comparison to cryptocurrencies, which have had more than 10 years to get to where they are today. Like all innovations, this adoption brings both good and bad, like when online sellers market famous brand names and products in the Metaverse as virtual goods or NFTs without permission. With this new virtual marketplace comes new questions for brands: How do real-world intellectual property rights apply to products in the Metaverse? How can brands protect their intellectual property?

Although bitsCrunch can’t fully respond to these questions and completely prevent all shady projects, the team can fight them and do its best to help brands remove these counterfeit NFTs from the NFT marketplaces and enforce their rights.

Going forward, bitsCrunch plans to strengthen cooperation with governments and financial institutions in the fight against crypto fraud and wash trading, and actively support a wide range of users — from novices to professionals — in the NFT and blockchain space, detecting and eliminating fraudulent activity across the NFT ecosystem.

On May 1, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao issued a warning to Tron founder Justin Sun regarding a deposit of 56.1 million TrueUSD (TUSD) to Binance. The Binance executive wrote:

“Our team told Justin, if he uses any of these to grab the LaunchPool Sui token, we will ‘take action against it’. SMH. Binance LaunchPool are meant as air drops for our retail users, not just for a few whales.”

In response, Sun said that Tron DAO’s primary objective in depositing TrueUSD “is to facilitate market-making between leading TUSD exchanges.” Nevertheless, Sun said some team members “inadvertently used a portion of them to participate in exchange campaigns.” Upon discovery, Tron DAO immediately contacted Binance and arranged for a full refund. “We sincerely apologize for this oversight,” the blockchain personality wrote. 

Sui is a layer-1 blockchain created by Mysten Labs. The project was founded by former Meta executives and raised $300 million in September 2022. On April 30, Binance LaunchPool opened the BNB-Sui and TUSD-Sui staking pools for its users. A total of 40 million Sui tokens, or 0.4% of the total supply, will be airdropped to users who stake their BNB

 or TUSD tokens over two days. Binance explained: 

“Binance will then list SUI when its liquidity meets the requirement and open trading with SUI/BTC, SUI/USDT, SUI/TUSD, and SUI/BNB trading pairs. Exact date and timing will be announced once available.”

At publication, over 9.4 million BNB ($3.1 billion) and 686.8 million TrueUSD have been staked in the Sui launch pools on Binance. The feature requires Know Your Customer verification and is unavailable in restricted countries, such as the United States or North Korea.
